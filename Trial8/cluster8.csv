Kawasan Falls canyoneering is what it is best know for and the crazy high cliff jumps.  We went with 3 kids so canyoneering was not possible but we did find a lot of other adventures.  We love traveling to exotic places and pushing our limits, especially the kids.  The color of the water was insane-everyone calls it gatorade water-yummy!  Check out the rope swings, jumps and rockslide it was a blast...

Another typical thing the dutch people do is to send their kids to swimming lessons. Our oldest started his lessons last year and once our second one turns 5, he would need to take swimming lessons too.

After a beautiful day cruising along on a private boat in Bohol, the Philippines… Being greeted by dolphins early in the morning, snorkelling, island hopping, and seeing beautiful sights, it's time to explore Bohol by land! We take our trusted bike on the trip of a lifetime, which starts with the Loboc river cruise, where we enjoy some amazing food, all-around good vibes, and SUNSHINE! The day is far from over as we pack adventure after adventure, zip-lining at the Loboc Ecotourism Adventure Park, we see some beautiful fluffy little creatures called Tarsiers and finish with a mind-blowing view over the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, The Philippines! This truly was the best day we’ve had so far… we will remember this day forever!

MjL05yopUzw,2022-12-30T02:49:31Z,UCM_LbQqMyM08jynil9vYEGg,IS BOHOL PHILIPPINES WORTH to VISIT? First time at CHOCOLATE HILLS in BOHOL (We saw TARSIERS!),"After a mostly relaxing day in Alona Beach, It is time for us to explore the rest of the island of BOHOL, PHILIPPINES in one day to witness the STUNNING CHOCOLATE HILLS, tarsiers sanctuary to see the tarsiers, which are the world’s smallest primates, butterflies, and much more!

Besides the Chocolate Hills, we were not sure what to do in Bohol, so we were glad to have someone show us around. While our day started out on a bit of a low note due to issues at the Loboc River Cruise, we were able to quickly turn things around and see tarsiers for the first time at a conservation area. 

The main attraction of Bohol is definitely the Chocolate Hills though and we were glad to link up with the amazing Mark Jun at Graham ATV who helped us through the Chocolate Hills by ATV and buggy. Being able to climb to the top of one of the Chocolate Hills and appreciate the INSANE view of Bohol is something neither of us will forget for a very long time.

We wrapped things up on our busy One Day in Bohol with a stop at the Bohol Man Made Forest, a very popular Instagram spot… although a bit of a dangerous one if you’re not paying attention! We learned a bit about its history as well and were glad to take in Bohol’s best tourist spots before heading back to Alona Beach.

Our first impression is that it is a city filled with welcoming and vibrant people who are excited to share their beautiful country with visitors. If you are wondering what Jordan is like, what there is to do in Amman, or if Jordan is safe to visit as a foreigner, then you have come to the right travel vlog. We loved just strolling down the streets today to begin to get a feel for the country. There are also some awesome sites to visit in Amman including the Citadel, amphitheater, and Rainbow Street, but really you should visit Jordan just to meet the people. We have only just begun our travel in this country and can already tell we are going to love it here!

We got castaway on a beautiful tropical island here in El Nido Palawan. One of the Philippines most popular islands. We were kindly invited to spend a few nights on the remote island of Darocotan Island with The Isla Experience. This was an experience like no other and its one we would highly recommend for your trip to the Philippines. In this video we live exactly like the locals. We stayed in a massive bamboo hut sitting right on the ocean. But Island life does not come without its sacrifices, for example, no AC, no wifi, communal toilets and showers, insects for room mates lol, and a few more. BUT its important to note that all this IS THE EXPERIENCE. We really enjoyed our stay on this remote island in El Nido. It forced us to take a break and disconnect from the world. Something we later came to appreciate. This is definitely one of the top things to do in the Philippines so if you would like to add the Isla experience to your Philippines itinerary you can find out more by checking out their website

Am ajuns in Coron, Filipine dupa ce am luat un ferry boat din El Nido patru ore jumate.
Ne-am cazat si am rezervat deja primul tur cu Miruna, Catalin si Goerge cu care ne-am intalnit pe Las Cabanas in El Nido.
Coron Ultimate Tour inseamna sase sau sapte destinatii: Twin Lagoon, Coral riff garden, Ship Wreck snorkel, CYC Beach, Kayangan lake si inca doua opriri.
Cand am ajuns in zona Twin Lagoon si am vazut ca puteam intra dintr-o parte intr-alta doar pe sub munte am avut un moment in care am inghitit in sec dar senzatia sa treci printr-un loc asa stramt si neprietenos intr-o laguna cu ""pereti"" inalti si cu apa calda a fost minunat.
Sa explorezi pe sub apa zona plus niste vase japoneze scufundate si sa mai ai si un GoPro la indemana chiar iti creste dorinta de a afla mai multe si mai multe si incepi sa iti cresti bucket list-ul.
Lacul Kayangan este unul din cele mai curate si limpezi din Filipine si cum l-am avut noi ca ultima destinatie din ziua plina a fost ca un dus cu apa dulce dupa ce toata ziua am fost o saramura :)
Am inceput aventura in Coron in forta si stim ca mai avem multe de vazut.
Pana data viitoare, sa ne-auzim cu bine!

It was a sunny day so I decided to get some sunshine - which is a rare commodity here in Ireland. LOL!  We're on Level 5 lockdown so we can only travel within 5km from our home and most shops are closed.  So, I took out the drone and my gimbal to take some really nice shots / clips around the city centre.  We're gonna have a quick tour around my town during lockdown. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did!

The drone shots were taken using DJI Mini 2.  It is super easy to use and takes 4K great quality videos! It's light so you don't need a license to fly it.

3 days in El Nido, Palawan. A good memory of beautiful islands, transparent marble ocean and nice people. This island is still somewhat hidden to tourists and some can find off-the-path travel here.

Some short info about this island:
El Nido is a coastal settlement and major tourist destination on the Philippines island of Palawan. El Nido comprises 45 islands and islets; limestone cliffs are also found here, which form a Karst backdrop similar to those found in Ha Long Bay, Krabi and Guilin. El Nido is a popular destination for locals during the long holidays of Holy Week but, until recently, has been relatively unknown to foreign tourists. Beaches, clear waters (away from the main town), jungle, steep limestone cliffs and stunning inlets make for beautiful seascapes.

It really was the most extreme activity we have ever done! It was so scary, but we had so much fun doing it! 

If you were ever thinking of trying canyoneering, we highly suggest trying it in Badian, Cebu. We recommend using Island Trek Tours (not an ad) as they were very professional, and our guide Kuya Ferdie kept us safe all throughout! He did not even allow me (Cherry) to do the last cliff jump which was 40 ft high, because my jumps were not that great. He said I needed more practice! And to top it off, the water was so calm and beautiful, blue gatorade like. There was also Kawasan Falls in the end which is a must see!
