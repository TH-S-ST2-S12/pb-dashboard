Are drones illegal in the Philippines? Yes, if you don't have written permission from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP).  These are the drone laws in the Philippines. 

I contacted the CAAP before I went to the Philippines to request permission to fly my drone also known as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).  It will take about 1-2 weeks to get permission from the CAAP so you may need to plan ahead before you leave for your trip.

The CAAP also noted that Airport customs may confiscate your drone if you don't have written permission from the CAAP to fly the drone in the Philippines.  Furthermore, the Airport Customs may charge you an import tax of 100,000 PHP (about 2000 USD).  This is video shows you what you need to know bring your drone to the Philippines.  I hope this video helps.  If you liked the video, please hit that like button and if you want to see other videos, consider subscribing.  Hope to see you again.

_________________________
Update: Aug 14 2017 - I received an email from the CAAP today. They've changed their policy since the making of this video a few months ago and I wanted to share the good news with you guys.  

Dear Sir/Madam:
 
Greetings from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines!
 
Please be informed that the Bureau of Customs (BOC) and this Authority had a discussion regarding the importation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) or commonly known as drones, to the Philippines.
 
During the discussion, both government agencies agreed that AUTHORIZATION for the importation of drones to the Philippines is no longer required. However, all RPAS owners and/or operators, whether engaged in commercial or non-commercial operations shall strictly adhere to the provisions stipulated in Philippine Civil Aviation Regulations Part 11; 11.11. (Electronic copy of PCAR Part 11 is attached)
 
Moreover, this Authority has also requested the BOC to advise all customs personnel in NAIA Terminals and other concerned offices not to require drone importers to secure an import clearance/permit from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.
 
Should you require further inquiries, you may call the Flight Operations Department of the Flight Standards Inspectorate Service at Tel.: (+63) (02) 944-2172.

Assistant Aviation Safety Inspector

The Bureau of Immigration on Monday said they are ready should the national government lift its restrictions on foreign travelers amid the continuing decline in new COVID-19 cases in the country.

“Our frontline officers at the airports are ready and prepared, and we assure the traveling public of uninterrupted service should they decide to travel to the Philippines,” Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente said in a statement.

Our channel is dedicated to providing Philippines videos, motivational and worldwide videos. I'm a Black expat (African American) dwelling in Cebu City Philippines. I work online gigs with Fiverr and Upwork for money.

In many of my videos, I share tips on how to make a living in the Philippines. Whenever you move to the Philippines you will need to live on a budget. I also have videos on the cost of living in the Philippines. Being a Black person in the Philippines comes with both its rewards and challenges because of your skin color.

I'm married to a beautiful Filipina. Her name is LisaD. She is lovely both inside and out. We have an interracial marriage and work hard at maintaining a good relationship. I have videos online and offline dating Filipinas in the Philippines and what it takes to maintain a long-distance relationship (LDR). Dating and romance in the Philippines are important also. We do worldwide and motivational videos too. In addition, we do Life In The Philippines News and Life In The Philippines Breaking News videos. Our Life In The Philippine Relationship Tips is a very popular playlist as well.
  
We've discovered that there's are many poor people here. Poverty in the Philippines is abundant. We do food drives on the channel and give out food to those in need. It's a way of giving back to those who are less fortunate. We believe in God. He is our provider. As he provides for us we bless others by sharing our blessings.

Born in Canada, we also chat about why Franco moved back to the Philippines and also why other overseas entrepreneurial Filipinos are returning. FULL VIDEO here: https://youtu.be/I0LSbXex9Cg

This clip is about how some entrepreneurial overseas Filipinos are returning to the Philippines to start businesses & the digital transformation of the country. 

In this podcast episode, Franco Varona, a Filipino Venture Capitalist, explains why the Philippines is one of the fastest-growing startup ecosystems in the region and the opportunities this presents for entrepreneurs. Born in Canada, we also chat about why Franco moved back to the Philippines and also why other overseas entrepreneurial Filipinos are returning. 

As the Managing Partner of Foxmont Capital Partners, the first independent Venture Capital (VC) firm in the Philippines, Franco has had a varied career, most notably being a founding member at MyTeksi Phillippines (now named Grab). This opportunity to get on board one of the most exciting startups in the region supercharged his career into what it is today, something that might not have been possible if he stayed in the States. 

As passionate advocates of the Philippines startup ecosystem, Foxmont's investment thesis is this:

“We invest in Filipino-focused or Filipino-founded early-stage technology startups that have proven that they can scale effectively and lead the Philippine digital evolution.  We believe that if a Filipino startup can succeed in the Philippines, it can succeed anywhere.”
