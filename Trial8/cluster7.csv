Everybody wants to know how to start a business, but have you ever wondered why you shouldn't start a business?

There are far more reasons not to start a business than there is to create one. Today I journey to Cebu City's Carbon Market to give sandals away to those who need them, and talk about my answers to why I think many people should not start a business.

If you have observed, most businesses don't make it in the first year. And out of those that make it, almost all of them get out of business by their fifth year.

Why is that?

When you start a business, you won't have as much free time as you did when you worked 9-5. You'll also have to work almost 24/7 until you get profitable enough to hire some help.

And if you're also someone who gives up quickly and only wants to start something and not work day and night to improve it, then entrepreneurship may not be for you. 

Persistence and determination is also key to making a business successful. And if you don't have that, ABSOLUTELY do not start a business. Be comfortable making mistakes and learn from them instead.

So think long and hard...

Is starting a business a great option for you? Let me know in the comments below.

And remember, don't start a business until you watch this entire video!

A quick note:
As an American expat in the Philippines, I want to help and support both expats in the Philippines and Filipinos. We came to Cebu City's Carbon Market to help a fellow American struggling with his business, but he wasn't there, unfortunately. Today was still fruitful, though, as we were able to give out sandals to Filipino children as planned.

Jf2tNIE-IHE,2022-11-18T10:30:10Z,UCxBWeubuZrc8sQE_bXytgUQ,Hong Kong Russian Couple First Impression of BGC Manila | We Love Filipino Food,"Title: Hong Kong Russian Couple First Impression of BGC Manila

In this episode, we finally visited one of the top recommended district here in Manila called BGC - Bonifacio Global City. We came without any expectations and let the experience took us. We DID NOT EXPECT BGC to be this stunning. As soon as we arrived, we were stunned by how beautifully the streets are decorated and managed, especially with beautiful Christmas decorations everywhere on the streets. Growing up in the metropolitan of Hong Kong, I love seeing citylights at night and the nightlights in Manila is a sight to see. It reminds me of home. 

We took a long stroll along the streets of BGC and there was a huge variety of food options from local cuisines to high quality international restaurants. We ended up dining at a top recommended Filipino restaurant called Manam to try Filipino cuisine. We were completely blown away by how delicious filipino cuisine was and we cannot wait to try more in the future.

This is our first Air travel again since Covid-19 start. We are excited but very anxious at the same time while were getting our tickets and clearing from TSA because you will never know what to bring for some sort of restrictions again.

Part 2 of our Filipino adventure involved heavy rain! but when the sun did come out we were rewarded with unrivalled views of El Nido. It is by far the most stunning landscape we‚Äôve ever visited.

El Nido

WHAT WE GOT UP TO: 

El Nido is a little coastal town in the North of Palawan. Travelers flock here to see some of the most stunning views in the world and we weren‚Äôt disappointed. 

We opted to see as much of the beautiful beaches and stunning lagoons around El Nido by taking a tour. There are four tours on offer: we would be participating in Tour A, the most popular tour, with Hello El Nido. 

Tour A itinerary:
üëâ Seven Commandos Beach
üëâ Big Lagoon (canoe not included in tour price)
üëâ Lunch on the beach (lunch provided)
üëâ Secret snorkelling spot (snorkel mask provided)
üëâ Hidden lagoon/secret beach

Note - the order of this tour may vary depending on the number of tours being carried out that day. 

The views around El Nido are stunning and it‚Äôs a great spot for snorkelling, diving, paddle boarding and canoeing. Within the town there are some great restaurants that face onto the beach with some gorgeous views of the huge rocks within the sea.

The big lagoon holds the bluest waters we have ever viewed. It is truly awesome and doesn‚Äôt quite look real - a definite must if you‚Äôre in the Philippines!

ABOUT US: We‚Äôre a couple based in Leeds, UK. Like everyone, we love a good holiday but we're making our love of travel the main part of the next year by backpacking and traveling to new places. At the end of 2018 we decided to undertake a big travel adventure whilst we‚Äôre young and with no commitments. At the moment we've planned to be away for one year but it could be longer! We moved out of our flat and in with parents to save money and have left our jobs ready to start our once in a lifetime tour ‚úàÔ∏è. We hope to vlog about our experiences and share with you our journey whilst backpacking. We‚Äôve got some idea of the areas we want to visit but this may expand whilst we‚Äôre away üó∫Ô∏è
