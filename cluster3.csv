As a foreigner in the Philippines...Why go to a Filipino restaurant when you can get delicious Pinoy street food, and be eating Balut, Isaw, and other strange foods? Manila especially is great for this!

Just a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. 

I'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. 

I'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party. Stay tuned!

Inspired by the Best ever food review show and their various interesting Filipino travel vlogs about foods like Catching and eating Wild Tamilok in Palawan.... Is this Philippines Strangest or Scariest Food? 

Where are my Filipino and Filipina subscribers at!? Would you try this?

Cockfighting… This is a very controversial sport and we never thought we would see something like this in person BUT we were in Moalboal in the Philippines and that seemed to be an attraction and thought we would check it out.  The kids were interested in going so we asked around and one of our drivers took us.  The last thing we wanted was for the kids to see something that would scare them, we were all watching for anything that made them feel uncomfortable.  We definitely don’t condone the  of any animals however this is a sport that happens in many countries.    We will not agree with everything that we see but educating yourself is not a bad thing.  

The vibe as we walked in was energetic, it was about to go down.  We had no idea that they strapped blades onto the roosters legs.  That brought this whole thing to another level.  We questioned if we should stay or go-the kids asked if we could stay and see what happens.  As we got a seat a man approached us and started chatting- it felt like we had to make a bet since we were there so we bet 100 pesos.  We also found out that the rooster was also cooked and eaten after that so that made more sense than just disposing him.
See what happens!

One of the most difficult challenges I faced is the language difference. Although Filipinos are great English speakers, they would most often speak in the native tongue when speaking to others. This means I won't understand what they were saying and would often feel out of place.

In this episode, I talk about what it is like to learn to communicate when I don't understand what others are saying around me.

Here's some episodes I'm sure you'll love:

You'll learn about what actually drove me to be moving to the Philippines. How living in Cebu is during the pandemic; What things I love (and hate), including the food I highly recommend you get a taste of when you're here. 

We will also take about business in the Philippines; the possibilities and difficulties of starting one as an expat living in the Philippines.

Of course, some travel advice if you want to go on a South East Asia travel, best places to retire, and a quick glimpse of the province life in the Philippines.

Oh, and watch me attempt to say some Filipino tongue twisters at the end of the video. And tell me if I did okay in the comments below!

About Kirby:
Kirby Pábalan-Táyag Aráullo is a renowned Filipino Culture Bearer and currently the National Coordinator for Culture and Heritage for NAFCON (National Alliance for Filipino Concerns). He is a Dátû and Lakan by blood, a direct descendant of the last indigenous Paramount Kings of Luzon (of both Lakandúlâ of Tondo and Rája Matandá of Maynílâ), and of the anti-colonial revolutionary Katipuneros who fought for the liberation of the Philippines from colonialism. Kirby's upbringing exposed him to the contradicting worlds of traditional politics and grassroots activism.

With a keen interest in varying fields (such as history, culture, government, and human rights) and a strong commitment to serve the community, Kirby studied in some of the world’s most prestigious universities, such as Harvard, UC Davis, and Université catholique de Louvain. Kirby is also the Co-Founder of the Bulosan Center for Filipino Studies and author of the book “Black Lives & Brown Freedom: Untold Histories of War, Solidarity, & Genocide.”  He is a visiting professor at various colleges in the Philippines and a research fellow with Sínúpan Singsing, an institute for indigenous advocacy and the study of Kapampángan language, history, and culture.

Dátû Kirby is an educator who is well-rooted in his culture and passionate about his heritage; he strives to decolonize Philippine history and democratize Ethnic Studies through knowledge and play.",Kirby Araullo,"['Kirby', 'Araullo', 'pinoy historian', 'reaction video', 'philippines', 'pinoy horror stories', 'day of the dead', 'Mikey Bustos', 'Pinoy', 'Filipino', 'Philippines', 'Tagalog', 'Comedy', 'pilipino', 'manny pacquiao', 'floyd mayweather', 'MIKEY BUSTOS', 'FILIPINO MYTHICAL Creatures', 'filipino reaction', 'reacting to filipino', 'MYTHICAL Creatures', 'filipino parody', 'filipino culture', 'filipino mythology', 'filipino mythology rap', 'filipino mythical creatures rap', 'philippines reaction', 'reaction to filipino', 'reaction time', 'history']",en,8705,560,0,127,US,React to Filipinos,Yes

My goal is to give tips and advice on life in the Philippines.

I have had the opportunity to live here in the Philippines and have visiting multiple places here in the Philippines and have the pleasure of enjoying the country, its people and the culture of the Filipinos. 

I hope to share my experience as a foreigner living here in the Philippines and to give back to foreigners visiting or expats planning to move here in the Philippines. I plan to post videos weekly that vary in content that will help foreigners and expats.

Is Philippines good for expats? 
The Philippines is a top-rated destination for expatriates. The country has a warm climate, friendly people, welcoming culture, and low living costs make the country an ideal destination for expats. 

Where do most expats live in Philippines? 
Most expats in the Philippines live in the Metro Manila area, particularly in Makati City – home to many international corporations and the heart of the country's diplomatic community. 

Can a US citizen live permanently in the Philippines? 
Yes, under the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, Section 13 (a) you are eligible for permanent residency in the Philippines. Is retiring in the Philippines a good idea? Retiring in the Philippines can be a great escape when done right. Overall, you're going to notice goods and services are cheaper than they are in the U.S. You can also find affordable healthcare as long as you retire in a location close to hospitals. However, certain parts lack infrastructure and investment.

Philippines Tourism Tourism is an important sector for Philippine economy. 

In 2019, the travel and tourism industry contributed 12.7% to the country's GDP.[1] Philippines is an archipelagic country composed of 7,641 islands with 81 provinces divided in 17 regions. The country is known for having its rich biodiversity as its main tourist attraction. Its beaches, heritage towns and monuments, mountains, rainforests, islands and diving spots are among the country's most popular tourist destinations. 

The country's rich historical and cultural heritage, including its festivals and indigenous traditions, are also one of the attractions of Philippines. Popular destinations among tourists are Cebu, Boracay, Palawan, Siargao, and many more.

http://www.filipinawives.com.au/romantic-old-fashioned-girls-philippines/

Filipina girls are generally still old fashioned romantics, and still dream of a knight in shining armour whisking them away and being married for life. They've lately had ""sexual freedom"" thrust upon them by the effects of social media and the new heros of their generation, but beneath all of this remains some soft-hearted and loving ladies who will appreciate a loving man who is happy to take care of them. Good news for Australian Filipina couples.

http://www.filipinawives.com.au/filipinas-trying-change-appearance/

Filipinos, like most countries that were colonised for a long time, possess a cultural cringe toward what is uniquely Filipino, always thinking that what happens in other countries must be better. That applies to skin colour, hair, noses and everything that involves their appearance. It's always a mystery to Australian men involved in Australian Filipina relationships why their beautiful Filipina girl would feel this way.

   international trip already) , 
*scanned of Visa size picture (headshot) , 
*Bank statement if available ( I used bank certificate instead), 
*Proof of me and my boyfriend are in genuine relationship ( I 
  provided collage pictures of our first meeting together ).
*I am Employed so I just used my own proof of Income and made 
  sure deposited enough in bank account before I requested for a 
  bank certificate .
*Tourist Visa cost - 141.37 AUD 

PLEASE NOTE that it doesn't mean it works to me will works for you too. To be safe just follow the checklist provided by the immigration online website. 
https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/600-/Visitor-visa-(subclass-600)-Tourist-Stream-document-checklist

Or do more internet research and apply online by yourself (What I did)
or look for a licensed migration agent for proper guidance, less hassle, less stress but might cost more 

For other questions that we didn't able to cover you may comment down below or email us or message us in our instagram. 
Hope this video will give you idea and help you in your future plans.

ODpvcLgLj9k,2017-01-30T23:54:25Z,UCm-AYPZjXxu25xkXl3IWr2g,5 Tips for Dating a Filipina (A Girl from the Philippines),"Here are my 5 tips for dating a Filipina! 

As a man married to a Filipina I have created some tips for people starting to date your prospective partner. In my own time I had to adjust to a lot of things in my relationship with my wife Ange. These tips would of helped me a lot during the courting phase of our relationship and I hope they help you as well.

Tips (click on the times to go directly to the points below) 

1. Family Matters 0:18

When you are involved in a Filipina's life you are involved in her families life to. One day money issues will pop up and you will be asked to help out, try to think of it like if your family was in trouble. Be a stand up guy and help out. 

2. Be aware of Tampo 1:31

Filipinas have a thing called Tampo this means they don't talk to you for hours, days or if it is really bad WEEKS! Don't stress this is part of the Filipino culture, take your time and tell your partner you will be with them and when you do find out what you did wrong MAKE IT RIGHT! Don't stress it happens to every guy dating a Filipino, you are not alone! Hang in there.

3. Try to learn Tagalog 3:08

Make a effort to learn your partners language she and her family will be impressed and respect you for making a effort for them.

4. Learn about life in the Philippines 4:38

Try to find out what is life is like in the Philippines and how it was different to your upbringing. When you encounter issues in your relationship you will be more adaptable if conflict is to arise. 

5. Rice 5:41

Filipinos eat rice or Kanin in Tagalog for breakfast lunch and dinner. If it is a first date make sure rice is involved in the meal.

Extra tip: Give her a chance 7:03

Don't listen to horror stores about scams with Filipinas. Give her a chance and put in the effort your girl deserves to make your relationship work.

Note:

I also made reference to ‘white culture’ throughout the video, watching back on this video during production it may sound strange so I am sorry if I offended anyone. I don’t really care if you are black/white/Asian ect I just say things how I see it and I hope you can understand. As a white male, living in Australia I only know what life is like my own shoes and within my own family, I didn’t want to take shots at any other ethnicity in what I said or especially to upset anyone.

Recently, a Celebrity Kuwaiti Blogger Social media star Sondos Alqattan has come under fire for complaining about changes to the country's Kafala System.

It now gives Filipino Migrant workers the right to have days off and to keep their passports. 

As you know I did a video on Joanna Demafelis, who was a Filipino domestic worker that was tortured and killed.  Her body was found in a freezer.

Here's what Sondos had to say ""For a maid to take off every week, that's four days a month. And we don't know what she'll be doing on those days, with her passport on her."" ---""How can you have a servant at home who gets to keep their passport with them?... I don't want a Filipino maid anymore.""

Alquatten has been heavily criticised since she posted her video on Instagram.  Many have called her remarks racist and have accused her of wanting to have a slave rather than an employee. In addition, many of her Beauty sponsors have canceled her contracts.

To Ms. Sandos, I say Shame on you!

Kuwait like most middle east countries operate a Kafala System, however, the Filipinos are now exempted from the system due to recent changes in the law. These changes were as a result of President Rodrigo Duterte placing a ban on OFW to Kuwait as a result of Filipino abuse and mistreatment. The ban was lifted when the Philippines and Kuwait signed a Bi-lateral MOI (memorandum of agreement).  This MOI protects the rights of Filipino workers.

In many places this system allows employers to control the migrant worker and terminate their contracts at will. The confiscation of passport and extremely poor working conditions have longed been a complaint of human rights groups. 

This video examines a KUWAITI BLOGGERS DISGUSTING REMARKS ABOUT FILIPINOS - CONDEMNED.

The question of the day. How do you feel about Ms. Sando's remarks?  Was it racist or just a statement of displeasure? I'd like to know your thoughts.  Put them in the comments section of this video.  And remember to like share and subscribe.

Our channel is dedicated to providing Philippines videos, motivational and worldwide videos. I'm a Black expat (African American) dwelling in Cebu City Philippines. I work online gigs with Fiverr and Upwork for money.

In many of my videos, I share tips on how to make a living in the Philippines. Whenever you move to the Philippines you will need to live on a budget. I also have videos on the cost of living in the Philippines. Being a Black person in the Philippines comes with both its rewards and challenges because of your skin color.

I'm married to a beautiful Filipina. Her name is LisaD. She is lovely both inside and out. We have an interracial marriage and work hard at maintaining a good relationship. I have videos online and offline dating Filipinas in the Philippines and what it takes to maintain a long-distance relationship (LDR). Dating and romance in the Philippines are important also. We do worldwide and motivational videos too. In addition, we do Life In The Philippines News and Life In The Philippines Breaking News videos. Our Life In The Philippine Relationship Tips is a very popular playlist as well.
  
We've discovered that there's are many poor people here. Poverty in the Philippines is abundant. We do food drives on the channel and give out food to those in need. It's a way of giving back to those who are less fortunate. We believe in God. He is our provider. As he provides for us we bless others by sharing our blessings.

_sR1cALLCVg,2018-05-21T11:34:23Z,UCPNBc7ZRwmgk1I6j_lenAfw,HOW TO LIVE IN THE PHILIPPINES 2018 (FOREIGNERS),"Well the dogs bark all the time and there are stray cats all over the place and the people are loud. Yeah, Guess What? Welcome to the Philippines.

ThePhilippines is a country that’s not like the United States.  They have a lot of things that are not developed as the United States, 

But that does not mean you can’t live here well.  But it’s not one of the most developed countries, okay?  The Philippines is not going to be like you came from.

I came from the United States and the Philippines is totally different in many many ways from the United States Of America.

So, as such, you have to understand that when you visit the Philippines, If you come to live or you come to visit, things are not going to be 100% just like it was where you came from.

And you have to make adjustments.  You have to make changes.  You have to accept the situation as it is.

Now you have heard the saying that it’s more fun in The Philippines.

Yeah, it is. Because it’s different. It’s how you accept the change that makes it more fun.

Me for example, I don’t like a lot of noise.  But I live in a subdivision and one thing I noticed is that when you live in the Philippines, everybody, just about everybody’s got at least one or more dogs.

And it makes for a very very Uh,   Noisey situation at times.

When the dogs, are out, like in my subdivision we have people walking their dogs all times of day and night. And you know when dogs get together they bark.

If they don’t like each other they just bark. And all times of day and night you’re going to find

Dogs barking.  And sometimes the stray dogs run in packs. 

That’s just one area that you have to adjust. I had a hard tie with that.  I’m not a person that likes a lot of noise,  I like it peaceful where I can think and make decisions and talk,

And so it took me a while.

It took me a while, but I’m okay with it now.  So don’t expect, everything to be exactly like it was where you came from.


Leave room for adjustments, be able to make adjustments, be able to make the transition.

I was ready to go back home after 3 months. Hahahha.  I really was,


Because I missed a lot of the things that I had become accustomed to in the United States.

But as time went on, I learned to adjust to my new surroundings. I learned to adjust to the new situations, and I learned to adjust to the new cultural settings.  

It takes time.  Nothing happens overnight.  

We invite you to share your opinions stories and real-life experiences on Filipino culture in the comments section of this video.  It might help and inspire someone and make the difference in their life.

Our channel is dedicated to providing Philippines videos, motivational and worldwide videos. I'm a Black expat (African American) dwelling in Cebu City Philippines. I work online gigs with Fiverr and Upwork for money.

In many of my videos, I share tips on how to make a living in the Philippines. Whenever you move to the Philippines you will need to live on a budget. I also have videos on the cost of living in the Philippines. Being a Black person in the Philippines comes with both its rewards and challenges because of your skin color.

I'm married to a beautiful Filipina. Her name is LisaD. She is lovely both inside and out. We have an interracial marriage and work hard at maintaining a good relationship. I have videos online and offline dating Filipinas in the Philippines and what it takes to maintain a long-distance relationship (LDR). Dating and romance in the Philippines are important also. We do worldwide and motivational videos too.
  
We've discovered that there's are many poor people here. Poverty in the Philippines is abundant. We do food drives on the channel and give out food to those in need. It's a way of giving back to those who are less fortunate. We believe in God. He is our provider. As he provides for us we bless others by sharing our blessings.

So I'm going to teach you some things that you should know when you're dating offline or online with a Filipina In order for you to avoid being scammed and broken.

Yeah, they can break your heart, they can break your soul, they can break your spirit, and they can break your bank!

Now when you talk about the Philippines you understand this is a country where they are numerous types of scams,

But the ones scam that's more prevalent than anything else if the online-offline dating scams, in the Philippines, mmm, mmm
It's a multi-million peso industry.

Whenever you meet a Filipina understand they have a mentality that says they're entitled to get your money.

In other words, because they feel they’re poor and they don’t have money and you have a lot of money They're entitled to go in your pockets. And it's ok so, They have no regrets about lying or misleading you, They have no regrets about telling you things that are untrue, It's just what they do to get what they want.

They expect the Filipina to be a fix it all and a do it all.
Unrealistic expectations can lead to conflict and disaster.
Relationships require trust commitment, financial stability, and patience to say the least,  in order to be enduring and successful.

I suggest that both parties need to bring compatible skill sets and sensibilities into the relationship. Anything less will eventually result in a failed relationship.

This video examines the question What are you bringing to the table?

Most Filipinas have natural outer beauty. But there are some that don't have the prettiest looks.

However, all too often it's common to see foreign men with the unattractive Filipinas. 

Why is this so? Very simply Filipinas possess a charming and endearing personality that draws people to them. Many people call this charisma.

The charismatic Filipina glows with radiance from the inside out. Outer beauty attracts but inner beauty captivates. Outer beauty fades with age but inner beauty lasts a lifetime.

Be careful of your tone. Filipinos do not like loud talking foreigners. Yeah, they don't like them and the thing about it is that Filipinos are somewhat loud themselves.

I mean when you're around Filipinos and you talk loud,, from a foreigner they think it’s rude.

And they don't want to be around you.  Ok so watch your tone of voice.

Watch your tone of voice watch if your loud or not because it would offend another, it would offend a Filipino

when you’re in the Philippines. You have to go not according to Philippine. Standard time, not according to your local time, but you’re going to go according to Filipino Time.

Not Filipino Standard time, but Filipino Time.

Okay? What does that mean? That means that whatever time you’re being told that you will be met by a Filipino, and you are supposed to be someplace, a Filipino is supposed to be someplace at a particular time, always expect them to be late.

If you expect to be there if you say I want to see you at 5:00 expect that Filipino to be there at 5:30 6 o'clock.

Our channel is dedicated to providing Philippines videos, motivational and worldwide videos. I'm a Black expat (African American) dwelling in Cebu City Philippines. I work online gigs with Fiverr and Upwork for money.

In many of my videos, I share tips on how to make a living in the Philippines. Whenever you move to the Philippines you will need to live on a budget. I also have videos on the cost of living in the Philippines. Being a Black person in the Philippines comes with both its rewards and challenges because of your skin color.

I'm married to a beautiful Filipina. Her name is LisaD. She is lovely both inside and out. We have an interracial marriage and work hard at maintaining a good relationship. I have videos online and offline dating Filipinas in the Philippines and what it takes to maintain a long-distance relationship (LDR). Dating and romance in the Philippines are important also. We do worldwide and motivational videos too. In addition, we do Life In The Philippines News and Life In The Philippines Breaking News videos. Our Life In The Philippine Relationship Tips is a very popular playlist as well.
  
We've discovered that there's are many poor people here. Poverty in the Philippines is abundant. We do food drives on the channel and give out food to those in need. It's a way of giving back to those who are less fortunate. We believe in God. He is our provider. As he provides for us we bless others by sharing our blessings.

Never Cause A Filipino To lose Face. The reason being is that you've caused them to lose face. You have shamed them.  When you cause Filipinos harm, emotionally, physically, psychologically, or otherwise, they will try and get revenge on you. They will try to get back at you. They will try to get a crack at you and that rhymed. Filipino people and most people in Asia and Southeast Asia in particular hate being ridiculed or shamed.

So the Nigerians have targeted the Philippines and in particular Philippines OFW's.  What is an OFW? An OFW stands for Filipino Overseas Foreign Workers.

So here's what happened on the 3rd of June, of this year, The PNP got word of some potential scammers in Imus City in the Cavite area.

They raided the apartment.  And when they raided the apartment they found four people which were Nigerians. They were in the process of scamming. Scammers online,  13 Nigerian scammers were nabbed. The PNP picked up all the tapes, videos, computer equipment, and receipts. 

13 internet fraudsters were in tears after getting arrested.  
Where they received money and funds.  So, the leader of the gang led the police to 3 other apartments in the Imus City area.

So a total of 13 Nigerian National were caught red-handed In the act of scamming OFW’s (13 arestado sa online scam sa Cavite 13 Dayuhan). Here's how the scam worked.

And this is one of the oldest scams in the world.  It's a variation the Nigerian scam called the 419 scam. These scams basically involved the victim sending money to the scammer in advance of them sending gifts or cash.

So they become friends with these people the OFW's.  Then they say you know I want to send you something. I like you. I love you.  But the catch is the victims have to send money to the scammer first to pay shipping charges or custom fees

The PNP estimated that this syndicate group the Nigerian National syndicate group pulled in over two million dollars.  So they are being charged with estafa.  In the Philippines which is a legal term which means Fraudulent activity or defrauding people.

The purpose of this video is to let you know. If someone is immediately befriended you, and they send you a friend request and you accept it and the next thing you know you’re buddy buddy. And they're telling you they want to send you funds.  Don't fall for it.

They're just trying to get your money that's all.  That's all it is they’re trying to get your money.

Be aware and be alert when people want to immediately befriend you.

That should be a red flag for you immediately.  That hey, something's not right here.

And don't send people money especially that you just met on the internet.

That just basic information basic awareness is all you need.  Don't be duped don't be hoodwinked and don't be a victim.  Protect Yourself,

Now Question of The Day.  What's the best way you can protect yourself from a scammer?
Leave your comments for me in the comment section of this video.  I want to hear from you. What you say just might help someone.

13 NIGERIAN NATIONALS ARRESTED FOR SCAMMING (IN THE PHILIPPINES)
The question of the day.  What is your favorite restaurant in the Philippines? I would like to know your thoughts and it could help someone as well.  Put them in the comments section of this video.  And remember to like share and subscribe.

While in Mexico, we feel struck by some characteristics that remind us of the Philippines. We were not totally confirmed by our thought at the beginning, but then we started to see the hype of filipino sharing their thoughts in the aspect that they think mexican culture and characteristics pretty much alike filipino culture as well.

In this video, we covers the aspect of mexican and filipino food, Mexican and filipino characteristics, how we feel about the safety in both mexico and the philippines. The main focus is on culture in both philippines and mexico so if you are interested in culture and tradition, definitely this video is for you. If you are traveling to Mexico or the philippines, we believe this video will help guiding you in the aspect of what you can expect to see, and help you understand the fundamental culture better.

Filipinas’ physical features, wits, quick thinking, and being known to be excellent mothers are what most men “crave”.

There is a multitude of reasons why foreign men want a Filipina for a wife. Due to her captivating looks, sense of humor, and smart ideas, falling in love with a Pinay can become easy.

Philippine culture puts a premium on matrimony as a permanent commitment and the sacred union of a man and a woman in love; hence, divorce does not exist in the Philippines. Filipino women are extremely thoughtful and affectionate and considered to have the highest regard for marriage. 

As a man, if you’re someone older, an Asian woman from the Philippines is more willing to enter into that kind of relationship. Dating Philippine women have been long proven to be a worthwhile experience and joining matchmaking services becomes a method for the men who are traveling to the Philippines to have better chances of finding the connection of their dreams.

TmgLhC31C1o,2021-07-12T07:31:30Z,UCHgKHbSc87ES-H_xLlh6j9A,Foreigners Admit THIS About Dating Filipinas,"The Philippines is a single man’s haven if they’re searching for Filipinas worthy of spending the rest of their lives with. Needless to say, numerous foreigners are drawn to this country because of the outstanding beauty of Filipinas.  

A significant majority of Filipino women want to date foreign men for one reason, and one reason only - they genuinely just want to find love.   

However, many men are still misguided by the misconceptions that plague Pinays. Foreigners who were led to believe the misconceived connotations about women in the Philippines ended up missing the opportunity of finding true love among them.   

It is time that you learn the truth about unfair stereotypes that bigoted and prejudiced members of society continue to peddle and become the reason why men stop seeking the Filipina pea to their pods.  

Society has always had a peculiar and often sinister way of branding an entire group of people on the actions of a few.

Make your Philippines travel all the more special by meeting Filipino girls. The Philippines is a place where you can feel like you’re the luckiest man alive being surrounded by hundreds of stunning single Filipinas of various ages.

34 ounces water

I will share one of my stories of this happening to me and also explain how you can help try and avoid this happening. It doesn't happen often but it can happen so you need to understand why.

All information shared in this video are just based on Roan's personal experience.  Our journey will be different and that's okay.  🙏

In my experience, I moved to New Zealand when I was 22 years old.  I was only on a visitor visa and there was a lot of uncertainty with what my future will be.  I eventually completed CAP and obtained my NZRN license.  Since then, my life has been thoroughly blessed -so much so that I want to share my journey with 𝐘𝐎𝐔.  

My goal is to help 1,000 nurses complete their NZRN registration, find their first job and settle in New Zealand.  Thank you for supporting my mission. ☕
