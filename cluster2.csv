Lyrics:

Manila, oh nana
I love to party with my friends in Manila.
Nothing compares to parties here in Manila.
The party's hot in Pilipinas
I'll show you how, come with us
Manila oh nana!

Tonight is the night to party it up, practice my pogi face,
So many places in Manila, party all night and day,
We Filipinos save our pera, it's time for us to play,
So in the house we take our first shots!

And so we always say ohhhh, 
Play songs on the gitara
And let's eat some pulutan,
And we take it like, 
Oohhhhh, we drink from the same baso, which goes around, hot shots shots shots shots

Manila oh nana!
So many ways to party here in Manila.
We Filipinos live to party and have fun.
It's time to party in Manila,
Mabuhay, Pilipinas
Manila oh nana!

Next it is time to ride a jeepney, I'm passing driver change,
To find a bar in Quezon City, the night is still early
Makati and Malate district, pulutan I'm hungry
Then Metrowalk popular with Tourists

And now we're gunna go oooooooohhhh party like we are conyos,
Classy Fort Bonifacio,
And then we party with Titossss
And Titas of Manila
With bands at Strumms, hot shot shot shot

Manila oh nana!
It feels so good to party here in Manila,
These hot shots taste like warm, candy cinnamon hearts,
Does Cinnamon mean that it's healthy,
Whatever, time to party,
Parties in Manila.

Oh, Balut! Yes, Kuya! I love Manila! I'll never leave! Nothing compares to celebrating life in Manila. Mabuhay ang Pilipinas!

Parties in Manila!
The next morning I'm fine and ready to get up.
Cuz I have work and it's already Tuesday na.
To make more money, cuz I'm gunna,
Party here in Manila,
Tonight again, oh yeah!

When they get stressed they have been known to commit suicide, so we had to be very quiet.  Their brains are smaller than their eyes and they have the largest eyes (compared to the body size) of all mammals. Tarsiers are carnivorous animals and catch their prey by leaping from one branch to another.  As we walked through the park they were very hard to spot, the only way you really knew where one was was by looking for the crowds of people checking them out and snapping photos.  They are the cutest little creatures I have ever seen (besides kittens) they are nestled up and hugging the branches it was absolutley adorable.  They even look like they are smiling at you- gaaahhhhhhhhh let my heart be still!
We had a BLAST visiting these small wonders and it remains one of our highlights in the Philippines.

Haley's reaction video on the taxi scam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg4NNW--yxg&t=154s


Taxi scams in the Philippines is nothing new. It has been around for numerous years, kinda likes how corruption is ever present there. This video is about me watching the news regarding the taxi scam incident in Manila that occurred last week as well as watching Haley's reaction video of the incident - putting my personal opinion and also sharing my experience as I traveled to the Philippines a couple of months ago.

Quick tip if you are travelling to the Philippines, research the destination of where you are going and make sure you equip yourself with a lot of information. Also use Uber or Grab (I mainly use Uber when I'm in the Philippines).

For example, I did a google search on Manila International Airport, I look at the website and click transportation taxi and this came up:

Scams

Manila Airport is wide famous for its scams regarding taxi services. It is wisely to take only the official, metered or pre-booked taxis. Given this fact, do not accept rides from people that approach you in the terminal – You may possibly be a victim of a scam.

In order to avoid scams, it is advisable to carry small bills, having your destination written down in a piece of paper and knowing the approximate fare of your trip to avoid being ripped off.

It is advisable to be special careful with the so-called Manila Concierges, which will ask you a tip for supposedly helping you hailing a taxi.


As you plan your trip, take the time to plan your public transport trips as well as your hotel stays. Find out about typical fares from the airport to your hotel, or from your hotel to the attractions you wish to visit.

Stay safe and happy travels!

Toy shopping here is crazy! There are so many toys to choose from!

So my family and I went to Greenhills Shopping Center in the Philippines. You can probably spend  4 hours there. There are plenty of things to buy there ranging from toys, second hand goods, pearls, Jewellery, fake shoes, fake watches, cheap electronics, souvenirs, sea shells, t-shirts, shorts, bags, even collectibles. 

The whole Greenhills shopping center is like a combination of a multiple shopping malls (Virra Mall, Shoppesville, Theatre Mall) , Unimart (you can buy groceries here), food court and indoor/outdoor flea market or night market or bazaar. 
Be very careful as it can be quite crowded especially during the holidays where pretty all tourists goes there to buy stuff.

Generally what you can find is that the second floor has all electronics, phones, tablets, power banks, etc. and and they also do repairs if you bust your phone or tablet and need repairs.
 
Parking here is insane, even picking up people is insane. Best bet - Uber or Grab, very cheap, just get picked up a block away.

Remember to bring cash as you can haggle. You can find ATM machines though

You can use credit card on some shops although I will only use it on legit shops such as Toy Kingdom, Converse Store, Adidas, Nike etc..

This is probably one of the best shopping place to visit
If you are a shopoholic and like budget shopping, this is one place you must not miss.  From imitation bags, shoes, knick-knacks, clothes to the best freshwater and south sea pearls that you will find, its all available in this place.

Thank you for watching!

A lot of you sent me questions about when things would open up here. Maybe you're planning to go on a tour around the islands, or perhaps you are moving to the Philippines from USA.

To be honest, I've already given up any hope of guessing when things would open up again. But I'm looking forward to going on a trip back to California to visit family, friends, and clients or travel around the Philippines.

I've had this John Smulo channel for about six (6) months now, and I want to get to know who is watching the videos. If you haven't left a comment or reached out to me on Facebook yet, let me know where you're watching from and what you get most out of this channel in the comments below. 👇

Anyway, so what's life as an expat in the Philippines like?

I also experienced challenges regarding cultural differences, and it's something you'll have to adjust to.

For one, Filipinos reacted differently when the pandemic hit. They just wanted to make it through struggles in life, unlike in the US where we have the luxury to debate whether we should wear masks.

The cost of living here also depends on how you want to live here. But there's definitely something in the Philippines for every budget.

The noises are also a major thing to get used to here. You'll hear dogs barking, roosters crowing, and karaoke sessions late at night. So it's definitely something you should consider when picking out a place to live in.

Since I came here to start a business, my experience living as an expat from other expatriates who moved here to settle and retire can be quite different.

We are officially leaving Thailand after 2 years and moving to the Philippines! 

In this video we show you the fight process plus our 5 hour layover in the Changi Airport in Singapore! 

✈️ Here is the list of requirements at the time to enter the Philippines: 

    ⁃    Must be fully vaccinated 
    ⁃    Covid Vaccination Certificate (WHO International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis)
    ⁃    VaxCertPH or National/state digital certificate of the foreign government which has accepted VaxCertPH 
    ⁃    Negative ANTIGEN test 24 hours before departure  
    ⁃     RT-PCR IS NO LONGER REQUIRED! 
    ⁃    Passport valid for at least 6 months at the time of arrival
    -    Proof of insurance
    -    Proof of accommodation
    ⁃    Return or outbound ticket to country of origin or next country destination 


The process was relatively easy, make sure you double check all your required documents and everything should be smooth from there - our experience was very smooth! 

Thailand to Singapore took approximately 1 hour 40 min on Scoot airlines. We then had a 5 hour layover in Singapore which was a little anticlimactic as we arrived after midnight and everything was closed! We were then super delirious for 5 hours before we boarded Scoot airlines again for a 3 hour and 40 min flight to Manila!!

Travel day took 15 hours in total! SHEESH we were destroyed after that!

⚠️The ONE HEALTH PASS is very important for entering Manila - after you receive your negative Antigen result make sure to fill in your one health pass online before you board your flight - it can be filled up to 3 days before departure. 

We are so excited to be in a new country filled with loads of new experiences and new memories! 
Next up we show you our first days in the bustling city of Manila! What should we do??

This vlog is our FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE PHILIPPINES 🇵🇭 CEBU CITY (2022).   We give our honest reactions to our new home thanks to CEBU CITY!  And ask ourselves: IS THIS HOW IT ALWAYS IS?  Because we sure do hope so!

Leaving Thailand behind was no easy feat BUT we knew our time had come to go explore the rest of the world.  And what better place to start this new chapter in our lives than the Philippines!  White sand beaches, whale sharks, sardine swims, jumping off gorgeous waterfalls, do I need to say more to convince you on our decision?

We’ve been here for a few days now and we figured it was time to give you all our genuine first impressions of this country. No filter, no editing of opinions, just genuine thoughts! 

So sit back, relax, and let’s all travel this beautiful country together and explore with that both of us!

If you’re new here…WELCOME!!! ❤️🤗. We could not be more thankful and happy to have you.  We hope to see you around here more and more often!!  Make sure to check out our previous videos exploring Thailand just to see what you can expect from the both of us here:  https://www.youtube.com/c/WillandJoseTravels/videos

And if you’re returning…THANK YOU!  We appreciate you all so so much and just how incredibly supportive you have continued to be 🤗

This is our FIRST TIME EATING FILIPINO STREET FOOD 🇵🇭  but we have to ask DO FILIPINO'S REALLY EAT THIS? 😱  (2022) while in MOALBOAL CEBU and figured we'd take you all along for the ride 😱!  Think of this vlog as People vs Food 🤣. From BALUT, KWEK KWEK, BALBACUA, AND ETC we try it all and film every single reaction that comes from trying these Filipino street foods!!

We couldn’t have done this without the help of our new found friend here in the Philippines, Micho!  He was kind enough to show us around this local food market in Moalboal (province of Cebu, Philippines) and show us how to eat like a true Filipino 🤗. He most certainly pushed us out of our comfort zones and made this experience much more enjoyable then we could have imagined.  So thank you friend!

- Special shoutout to the family that run the food stall where we tried our intestines and kwek kwek, they were so kind, accommodating, and just a beautiful representation of the Filipino people ❤️ Thank you so much!

Alright guys, now it’s time to sit back and watch these two crazy Americans try some Filipino street food and every silly reaction that may come from it 🤣

If you’re new here…WELCOME!!! ❤️🤗. We could not be more thankful and happy to have you.  Make sure to watch our FIRST IMPRESSION S OF THE PHILIPPINES video here 😱:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ndkOSiGOe4. And if you’re returning…THANK YOU!

However, we are glad we made the drive.  From visiting TAAL VOLCANO to Mother of all Asia we made sure we got to see these standout landmarks with our very own eyes! After all we’ve heard so much about them and we now know why 😍

Batangas is a province in the Calabarzon region on Luzon and is only short 2 hour drive south of Manila!  Filled with many attractions Batangas is a very popular tourist destination for Metro-Manila.  This is where we got to see Mother of All Asia in all her splendor and she did not disappoint 😍. In fact, she was more impressive in person than we had even imagined!

After our time in Batangas we made our way about an hour and half north to the province of Tagaytay.  Another popular tourist destination here we got to see the infamous Taal Volcano 😱. Unfortunately due to a recent eruption you can no longer make your way over (the Taal Lake) to see the volcano up close and personal.  Before the eruption you used to be able to in fact climb Taal!  Hopefully one day soon we can also make our way to the top and show you all that view!!
*** FOR THE RECORD:  We know Taal Volcano's main center is in fact not the mound and crater of Binintiang Malaki: however, it is just so pretty haha ❤️ ***

Needless to say we had alot of fun during our time here.  Though there is so much left to do, we walked away with a great appreciation of the area and will gladly visit again 🤗 

Thank you all for taking the time to watch our video(s), comment, and continually give us a warm welcome!  It truly means the world to us both ❤️. We truly hope that you can walk away from our videos just a little bit happier than when you started or at the very least inspired even in the slightest…or heck, we’ll be satisfied with a smile haha 😊.

And in case you are wanting to visit these places yourself…here are their locations!!!

Our time in the peninsula of Zamboanga has been nothing but eye opening and incredible.  Yes, Zamboanga is riddled with it's overt share of negativity but the past is just that: the past.  No place in the world is free of negative whispers and struggles that came before.  However, instead of allowing fear to keep us from making our way to the island of Mindanao we instead turned that into a flight ticket and came to see for ourselves.

Not only did we encounter some of the friendliest locals in all of the Philippines, but learned a great deal about the many cultures that call this city home, and experienced things we never thought we would experience...and we still haven't even touched the surface!!

If you are new here: WELCOME and thank you so much for taking the time out of YOUR day to support the both of us.  And if you are returning WELCOME BACK friend 🤗 your faces and names always make the both of us smile and we can't wait to catch up with you all in the comments very very soon ❤️

Since we arrived for the first time in Manila we wanted to try out every form of transport there is here. Many Filipino friends recommended us to try the most colorful rickshaws, tricycles and ecobikes through this metropolis.

And this is what we did! Through sunshine and rain we found our way through Manila with the public transportation, including the famous Manila LRT line, the everyday commuting train running above the bustling city.

Four years ago Dolomite beach didn't exist. Now is is very popular hangout place for many of the Filipinos living in Metro Manila, because of the beautiful sunset you can catch every evening from the Manila Bay and also because of the water sports you can do here, like windsurfing.

We walk on the Manila Bay Dolomite Beach and see how Filipinos eat balut, one of the most popular snacks in the Philippines, while we try some dry barbeque squid.

Quezon City is the most populous city of the Philippines! We will discover a part of it, called Eastwood City, the first business district in the country, with skyscrapers towering over cafes, malls and restaurants. Many told us this is the San Francisco of the Philippines, others said this is straight up called The City Of Stars. Is it because all media outlets have their offices here or because of the Star Alley with Philippine's most famous personalities? What do locals and foreigners think about the biggest city of the Philippines?

Since I arrived in the Philippines I got many comments from you guys recommending me to try lechon. It's one of the most popular foods here and quite famous. I heard that there is a very popular lechon place here in Cebu, so I had to give it a try. The place is called ""Rico's lechon"" and many locals told me that it's the best place in Cebu to eat lechon. All I know so far about lechon is that it's pork and a popular filipino food.

Welcome to a new adventure series here in Cebu. In this episode, we hit the streets of Cebu to find laundry services as well as do grocery shopping. We went without any expectations and to give an honest unfiltered reaction about Cebu. 

As soon as we hit the street, we realised the traffic here in Cebu is quite similar to Manila - very heavy traffic, but after visiting Manila we have gotten pretty used to the crossing in big traffics so it weren't too surprised. We then found a laundry place where we dropped our clothes and ticked off one thing on our to do list for the day.

For some reason, police came to us and asked us to stop recording in the middle of the CBD for unknown reasons. We were very confused as to why GoPros arent allowed to be used while phone can be used for vlogging.  

Anyway, we arrived at Ayala Mall with the hope to find supermarkets to buy groceries. We went to MarketPlace which is a reputable international supermarket which is as expected charges a more premium price, so instead we went to Metro Supermarket which is downstairs and has a wider range of products we can choose from.

Time flies and we spent an hour walking around the supermarket. In total we spent 3500 pesos for 1 week for groceries then it is time to go home.

We arrived home with a lot of thing from the supermarket and revealed what we purchased from the store and also gave a room tour about our place for the month.

Continuing on our adventures in the Philippines, we arrived in Divisoria, a district well known for selling low-priced products and its diverse manufacturing activities. We arrived Divisoria with no expectation and was surprised by the wide range of products you can find in malls, street markets. From clothing, electronics even Chrismas decorations you can find it all here.

We arrived Divisoria via PNR which stands for Philippine National Railyway. For some reason the google map location was not accurate and we were unable to find the markets at first but luckily with the help of the locals, we managed to finally find the markets. After walking for around an hour, we  decided to buy a Ringlight for our tiktok production which costed 800 pesos. We then hit the streets and tried some street food as well which is a fried hard boiled egg skewer, together with the hot sauce it tasted amazing.

Welcome to another episode in the Philippines. In this episode, we decided to visit a new area in Manila called Quezon City and more specifically visit a top University here in the Philippines - the University of the Philippines Diliman. Upon arrival we were completely stunned by the outlook of the campus, surrounded by beautiful greeneries and parks all around, it was such an amazing place for tertiary education and no wonder it has produced some of the top grads in the Philippines. We stumbled upon a live music concert that happened on the day and enjoyed Filipino food from local street vendors.

Welcome to a new episode here in the Philippines. Ever since we arrived in the Philippines, many of our new subscribers have been recommending us to visit a beautiful area called Tagaytay, a popular holiday town south of Manila on the Philippine island Luzon. Known for its mild climate, it sits on a ridge above Taal Volcano Island, an active volcano surrounded by Taal Lake, it is one of the high recommended most beautiful places near Manila.

In this episode, we embarked on an adventure to Tagaytay by bus from Pitx in Pasay. It is our first road trip in Manila, so we did not have high expectations. Since we were the first few who got on the bus, were got to pick our own seats close to the driver, who was super friendly and talked to us the whole bus journey. 

As soon as we arrived, we checked into Anya Resort Tagaytay where we gave a brief room tour. After that we decided to venture out the resort and eat local Buko pie at a famous bakery and it was incredibly delicious. 

The Hotel we stayed at: Anya Resort Tagaytay

Location of Buko Pie: Cecilia's Buco Pie, Tarts and Pasalubong

Welcome to a new episode here in the beautiful metropolitans of Manila!

While getting a haircut is something that most people do on a regular basis, Justin rarely gets a haircut because of his signature long hair, and bandana look aka the Japanese hairstyle.
Over the past 6 months, Justin did not want to cut his hair mostly due to sentimental value and waiting for a good opportunity to get a special haircut. He was thinking of either the Indian flaming haircut or a cheap local haircut off the street etc. However, after living here in Manila for 3 months, Justin finally cannot bear the heat and is desperately in need of a more breathable yet affordable haircut.

Knowing that he could not get a cheap haircut in BGC, Justin decided to venture out of BGC through “the hole” to a local area called Pitogo on a mission to find a haircut. With the help of friendly locals around the area, Justin managed to find a decent local barbershop called Alron Barbershop. Upon arrival, it was not what Justin expected!

Welcome to a new episode here in the Philippines. Ever since we arrived in the Philippines in Novemeber 2022, we have fallen in love with filipino food because of its huge variety of dishes, tastes and affordability. 

In this episode, we embarked on a food adventure in the Philippines in a local area that I have never previously explored in the city of Taguig. Prior to coming to Taguig local area,  I never realised Taguig is this big and that BGC is only a small part of this city. Upon arriving in the area, I was already shocked by how chaotic the roads were, with jeepneys, and tricycles horning everywhere, but regardless we had 2 missions. The first is to collect an international parcel from America, and the second is to grab a delicious Filipino breakfast in the area. After collecting the parcel and walking around the streets for a while on the hunt for delicious yet safe food options, I finally found a local restaurant on the side of the road that looks seemingly safe. I ended up ordering the sizzling liempo which tasted absolutely amazing.

Welcome to a new episode here in the Philippines. Continuing on our adventure here in the city of Manila we have arrived in another local district, on the outskirts of Manila called Marikina City, also known as the city of shoes. The locals describe Marikina as so different to metro Manila, from transportation to food to social discipline, as if it is a whole different republic. 

In this episode, one of our subscribers Rick who is a local in Marikina offered to tour me around the city of Marikina. We met up at Marikina Park and slowly proceeded to Marikina Public Market to explore signature dishes and snacks, inside the wet market. We then visit local bakeries and restaurants, trying some of Marikina's favourites such as Puto and Everlasting.

Have you been to Marikina? If you haven't, would you visit sometime? Let me know in the comments!

It is not a Filipino problem, it is not a western problem, and in my opinion it is not a problem at all. It has always existed and always will exist. Where it becomes a problem is when it is forced upon women and their rights are violated. If you have an issue with seeing the fact/reality of prostitution happening in Cebu City, Skip the video, or feel free to dislike or comment on the video. It is not my intention to portray that all women in Cebu are like that. Certainly that is not true- just see my other videos to understand who I am before you jump to conclusions that I am one of ""those"" westerners. The title is simply serving its purpose: that is to get you to click on the video. I make daily videos of whatever happens to me while traveling. I was simply walking through a shopping center and was acosted by at least 5 women. It was not my decision to make that happen. So yeah, I am going to make the vlog about that. Again, prostitution happens wherever humans exist, it is actually quite normal. I just found it funny that I was mobbed by all these women. If you have an issue with prostitution, it is not my fault that it is happening. Thanks for understanding.

We soon discover that we need to get some supplies to make our next week visiting with my parents more comfortable so we take a trip to the shopping center via Philippine tricycle.  We could have opted to take a Jeepney, but we were doing a lot of shopping so the Jeepney would have not been as convenient.  Traveling around in the la union tricycle is a very open air experience.

They even have a huge bouncy castle, which has a very questionable center piece.  haha.  This makes Mall of Asia one of the top malls in Manila if not the Best mall in manila.

You'll see firsthand what to expect on the trip.  I also share 10 tips that should make for an easier and comfortable bus trip.  If you liked this video, hit that like button and if you want to see more of my adventures please subscribe.

Top 10 Travel Tips for riding the Bus in the Philippines

1. There are 2 major Bus terminals from Manila,  Pasay and Cubao. Depending on where you originate, you will need to decide.

2. When you get to the bus terminal, they’ll issue you a ticket with a number on it, this ticket places you in line to buy a ticket.  The wait can be 5 minutes or 5 hours. 

3.Generally, daytime is a lot busier than at night time.   We waited 3-4 hours to get on the bus during the day, but previously when we took a night bus we were able to get on the bus right away.  

4. There are 2 types of busses.  Regular bus and Deluxe bus.  If you can get on a Deluxe bus, I highly recommend the upgrade.  

5. Tell them where you are getting off.  This way they can order your luggage and stop at the correct location.

6. Snack vendors get on the bus all the time trying to sell you their goods. Be mindful of your stuff at all times.

7. Not many pee breaks, we only stopped once in our 5+ hour journey. 

8. When you do use the bathroom, you’ll need to pay a few pesos.  Keep some change on you.

9. You might not like the food, so we actually packed sandwiches. 

10. The bus temperature is super cold.  Remember to bring a sweatshirt, some long pants and maybe even a blanket.

we went to Ayala Mall. We were feeling the Saturday excitement and vibes of the Filipino people shopping and having fun.

Family bonding is so very important in the Philippines and it's important to us as well. We take every opportunity to sit down and relax and enjoy company together.
God has been good to us. LisaD and I have been blessed. We thank God for it.

In this video, we discuss many topics, we talk about the importance of family bonding, good hotels to stay in Cebu, Ayala Mall events, what christening is to Catholics, and many other topics.

This video examines Saturday Vibes In The Philippines.

The question of the day. What do you like to do to have family bonding time on a Saturday?  Leave your comments for me in the comments section of this video. And remember to like share and subscribe.

About Divertliving

American and Thai travel couple left the career in military and finance to become travel story teller. We met in 2015 in South Korea when Jimmy was in U.S. army and Tah studied for bachelor degree. In 2017, September, we both started traveling and created ' divertliving ' to share with world that we are not rich, but we can still travel well and enjoy our life. The content is uploaded almost everyday, providing real travel experience, traveling tips, struggle we have been through while traveling. You will see how it is like traveling as a mixed couple, it is greatly challenging in terms of cultural difference ( and so many more differences )

Manila travel vlog,"Today I went to Bonifacio Global City (BGC) in Manila, I have visited BGC twice before, but it was a few years ago. Many people have asked me to give my thoughts on BGC. I think it's a very nice city, very clean and seems like a great place to live. For my taste it's a little too nice and perfect, I do prefer more of the local vibe. I really enjoyed some great restaurants there and have previously enjoyed the nightlife! I think Bonifacio Global City would be a great place to live in Manila!

Apo Whang OD born February 17, 1917, also known as Maria Oggay, is a Filipina tattoo artist from Buscalan, Tinglayan, Kalinga, Philippines. She is often described as the ""last"" and oldest mambabatok (traditional Kalinga tattooist) and is part of the Butbut people of the larger Kalinga ethnic group.

She has been tattooing headhunters and women of the indigenous people of Butbut in Buscalan, Kalinga, since she was 15 years old, but the Butbut warriors who used to earn tattoos by protecting villages or removing enemies no longer exist. Despite this, Whang-od continues to practice her traditional art form on tourists visiting Buscalan.

We take the 12 hour road trip in the hope of not just meeting the legendary Whang-od but to be tattooed by her. 

There have been many foreigners who have traveled to the north of the philippines on the epic journey but this one is ours and we hope you enjoy this epic adventure and life journey.

From trying to figure out how to get around, eating some pig face, meeting so many friendly Filipinos and getting a tattoo by a stranger 😳 Yep, this is definitely an epic start to our adventures in the Philippines!

Thank you to @gabtattoo for the spontaneous tattoo souvenir! You guys really made our first day in the Philippines super unforgettable. We love the tattoo! Go check out his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChzeA8_vbhRoXAeSEm8nnEw

In this video, we fly from Singapore, Changi Airport into Clark International Airport, before catching a 3 hour taxi to Manila. We check into our hotel, fall asleep, and get ready to explore!

We’re staying in the Makati City area of Manila, so we set out on foot to see what the city has to offer - whilst searching for some local food, particularly Banana Cue and Banana Turon!

We met so many nice and lovely people - Manila gave us the best Welcome to the Philippines we could ask for!

Seriously, what a cool city here in The Philippines… we arrived on a flight from Boracay and we’re immediately impressed - the airport, on Lapu Lapu island, was so modern and clean. We ordered a grab from the airport to our hotel, and quickly got to exploring the city.

Of course we tried the famous Cebu Lechon, and YES it lived up to the hype - SO tasty.

We then went and explored Magellans Cross and the Basilica del Santo Nino, before heading across to Fort San Pedro and Plaza Independencia to learn a bit more about the history of Cebu City and the Philippines.

After this we strolled through Carbon Market, Cebu City and… well you’ll have to watch to find out!

(didn’t go to plan) 🇵🇭,"The Mall of Asia in Manila, The Philippines is the third biggest mall in the world, and the biggest in the Philippines. In this video, we head to this mega complex to see it for ourselves, only to be blown away by its sheer size, and to get very quickly lost amongst all the world class shopping.

The BEST part about this area though is the fairground atmosphere you can find JUST outside in the SM by the Bay setup - carnival rides, games, and the SM Mall of Asia Eye - a massive Ferris wheel similar to the London Eye - all overlooking Manila Bay. 

There is also Filipino streetfood and just such a great vibe here - but make sure you go on a non-rainy day!

We start our day at a Philippines street market - Salcedo Saturday Market, a large open air community market that has been serving local Filipinos for over 15 years. There is so much here to discover and eat - we try Ube for the first time, as well as Filipino BBQ skewers - so good! 

We then took a long walk and ended up in the Poblacion area, checking out P. Burgos, the Main Street for Manila nightlife, where we grabbed a coffee from a cool little shop.

After that, we ended the day with a late lunch at El Chupacabra, a famous Mexican/Filipino fusion spot that served some of the best food we have had so far in Manila. We had such a great day, so come along with us to enjoy Manila, The Philippines!

Siargao is a tropical paradise, known for its world-class surfing waves, stunning white sand, palm tree and laid-back island vibes.

We heard a lot of good things about Siargao. It is a hippy community so people are friendly and the food really surprised me, it is so delicious. The local Filipino food has better options for me and the crazy number of vegetarian options were great for Dan. Our accommodation was a 9 mins walk to cloud 9 beach. We came to cloud 9 beach to watch the surfing and beautiful sunsets every night.

I have a long flight starting from:
🇮🇩 Saumlaki ✈️ Ambon,
🇮🇩 Ambon ✈️ Makassar ✈️ Surabaya,
🇮🇩 Surabaya ✈️ 🇸🇬 Singapore,
🇸🇬 Singapore ✈️ 🇵🇭 Philippines
I have almost 24 hours more in total for this flight including a long layover duration too. So overall🙌🏽 the experience of traveling alone abroad is not as difficult as I thought. Everything went very well, I’m so happy and I met many friends on my long way trip. When I arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport I met some very friendly Filipino, they helped me find a charger for my iPhone. In addition, I also learned about the Philippines language. The first word I learned was ""Magandang Umaga"" which is Good Morning. This is a very pleasant first impression. I love it! See you on the next Moment!

Our family arrived in Manila late last night—and after a travel day of uncertainty that was caused by a powerful typhoon sweeping through the northern Philippines the previous evening. We weren’t sure we were going to make it into town at all, but now that we’re here, we’re ready to explore the city’s sites and bites. Today, we’re trying to fit in way too many stops, including but not limited to, checking out the Manila baywalk and beach, visiting the largest mall in Asia, exploring the top street food of the oldest chinatown in the world, and eating the cheapest Michelin-starred meal on the planet.

Who am I?

A man from the USA trying to discover the world one place at a time, while sharing the experiences through my lens. I like traveling to places that are usually not first on most people’s itinerary and showing everyone that these places are worth the journey. I want to experience all the countries I visit as a member of the society but at the same time learn about the culture, food and beautiful people. Growth is not achievable without leaving your comfort zone, so just do it!

As soon as we step out of our apartment in Makati, we are overloaded by Christmas decorations, holiday cheer, and the kindest people wishing us “happy holidays & a warm welcome to the Philippines”! We start with a delicious coffee in one of the quirky cafes in this area of Metro Manila, followed by a street food weekend market where we try some Filipino snacks! You can’t have the first day exploring a new country without some sightseeing… followed by the complete polar opposite: the biggest shopping mall in the Philippines! We tried our very first Filipino dessert, and it did not disappoint! With Christmas decorations EVERYWHERE, we feel right at home! We made the right decision to come to Manila, the Philippines, for Christmas!

Cebu, Philippines ➖ When I was walking down the street earlier in the morning, I was asked by some locals to try out the famous Filipino beer known as Red Horse! I was on my way to get a haircut, so I said I'd come back! I then found them again, ready to drink and enjoy time with the locals. They were super friendly, so I decided to stock up their supply and have a few more beers with them. Overall, Red Horse is a very pleasant beer. Quite strong in alcohol percentage, but still very delicious to drink on a hot day!

El Nido, Philippines ➖ I'm in much need of a haircut and shave, so I'm on the hunt for a barber here in El Nido. After a 10-20 minute ride trying to find one, I came across this local barbershop, with a customer just finishing up his trim. For just $4, I got a fresh cut and shave to clean up the mess that my head was growing.  Although this is the quickest barber experience I've ever had, it was actually one of the best. Quick, efficient and stylish, just the way I like it!

Manila, Philippines ➖ When Luke visits a new country, there are a few certainties, one of those is a big market hunt to stock up on local merchandise and goods. So Roy and I decided to go to the busiest market here in the Philippines, the Divisoria! I love the hustle and bustle of the market, it is so chaotic and crowded, and I always find interesting things all around. Of course, to get there we had to go by the local transport known as a jeepney! These unique vehicles are a fun and exciting way to see the city at an affordable cost. We bought some items, tried some street food and caught a crazy tricycle at the end of it all! Dive into this crazy, fun adventure with me here in Divisoria, tara na!

They decided to go somewhere with air conditioning: SM Mall of Asia in Manila, Philippines (also known as the Mall of Asia or MoA). Have you been here? This modern Filipino mall is huge. We thought we had entered it from the front entrance, but actually found ourselves turned around. Our first goal was to find food (that is probably NOT a surprise to you). Granite requested that we find sushi. Then, we found his favorite sushi chain called Genko Sushi. At Genko Sushi, you place your order on your phone and a bullet train delivers it to your table. Granite highly recommends this experience! 

We were looking for a trampoline or bounce park but found Laser Tag for the older kids and the Cosmic Kids play zone for Forest (Granite and Cedar did a great job chasing after him). After playing, we got a fun treat at Tiger Manju. The best way I can describe it is a fish-shaped mini waffle filled with a variety of flavored custards. Before we left the SM Mall of Asia, Cedar requested that we end the day with bubble tea. We probably spent about four hours at the mall and we barely explored it. We can’t wait to come back to Manila for more adventures. 

This was our last day in Manila! It surpassed our expectations. With the festival, historical sites, and endless neighborhoods of street foods, we really needed a few more weeks here. We look forward to coming back! In our next video, we will get our bags packed and head southeast to Cebu City.

We have filmed water parks and kid play areas, but this is our first attempt at taking the kids to an amusement park. Join us as we explore Star City in Manila, Philippines. This theme park has something for kids of all ages. Watch as Forest rides his first roller coaster! His favorite thing was the dinosaur display, though. Granite and Jonathan go on the scariest ride of all. Granite makes me (Kelly) go on his first upside-down roller coaster. We all feel sorry for Cedar, she was too short for the big rides and too big for the little rides. Despite the letdowns, she didn’t complain or let them ruin her night. We ended the night on the Ferris Wheel, watching Manila’s city night lights from high above everything. We had lots of amusement park snacks like popcorn, hotdogs, and fun drinks. I think we can all agree that the best part of the night was meeting so many fun people while waiting in the queues.

In this video, we are flying from Kuala Lumpur to Manila with Air Asia. It's our first time visiting Manila, and we are extremely excited to explore this vibrant city.

After arriving at our Airbnb in the Makati area, we head out to the Greenbelt Mall to check out the local shops and grab some lunch. We've heard so much about Jollibee, a popular Filipino fast food chain, so we decide to give it a try for the first time.

Next, we take a walk around the local area to get to know the city and its culture. The streets are bustling with life, and we're amazed by the energy and diversity of the people.

As the day draws to a close, we head over to the CCP Bay Terminal to watch the stunning sunset over Manila Bay. It's the perfect end to our first day in this amazing city.

Join us on this exciting adventure as we explore Manila, and the Philippines, try new foods, and take in the sights and sounds of this incredible city. Don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe to our channel for more travel vlogs like this one!

Manila is a vibrant city that is often overlooked by travelers who spend very little time exploring and discovering its diversity of people, restaurants, and shopping. Makati, a popular area for first-time visitors, is a bustling commercial and financial hub that offers a glimpse of the city's modern side.

One of the most fascinating aspects of Manila is its transport system. The jeepney, a colorful and unique form of public transport, is the most popular way to get around the city. It's an experience like no other, as you hop on board and weave your way through traffic while observing the hustle and bustle of the city.

For history enthusiasts, Intramuros is a must-visit destination. This walled city within Manila feels like you've traveled back in time, with its Spanish colonial architecture and cobblestone streets. You can take a guided tour or explore the area on your own, but either way, it's an experience that will transport you to a different era.

Lastly, I visited the beautiful Rizal Park, named after the national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal. The park is a massive urban green space that offers a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a popular spot for locals and tourists alike, with its gardens, monuments, and fountains that make for a picturesque backdrop for photos.

Overall, my first impressions of Manila were that it's a city that is full of life, culture, and history. There is so much to discover, and I highly recommend spending more than just a few days in this bustling city to truly appreciate all that it has to offer.

When we first arrived in the Philippines we were immediately invited to a family party in Pampanga, so it has taken us a little longer than we expected to explore the Philippines capital city; Manila. There are so many tourist places to explore in Manila, so we chose the best tourist spots according to our taste and are excited to share our first day exploring Manila with you.

First up, we visited Bonifacio Global City (BGC) which is a luxury piece of Manila that attracts many foreigners because it is very safe and has all the comforts that Western foreigners are used to. The shopping and coffee are amazing, but what really makes this place worth visiting are the free-roaming cats and the dogs in strollers!

Then, to really get a feel for the city, we took the Manila Metro! The metro was CROWDED, but, it ran well and was really affordable. We love taking public transportation when we get to a new city, and Manila is a great place to learn how to use the metro system because Manila traffic is terrible (seriously, we can't emphasize this enough!). If you are a traveler visiting Manila, we highly recommend learning how to take the metro system to save yourself money and a few headaches :)

After our packed metro experience, we rewarded ourselves with Jollibee! For me (Nicole) it was my first time trying Jollibee, and boy did visiting Jollibee make a lot of things about Mico make sense! You'll have to watch the video for all of the details, but when we left Jollibee's I felt like I had put a few pieces of the puzzle of Mico together at last. Maybe it really is true that Jollibee is part of the fabric of being Filipino, even for those Filipino who have been living outside of the Philippines for many years :)

With the energy to explore (actually fried chicken made us feel tired haha) we visited Rizal Park and learned a bit about the Filipino patriot, Jose Rizal. After touring Rizal Park we made our way to Intramuros - a very popular tourist spot in Manila. Intramuros is a beautiful area that gave us a chance to learn more about the Spanish conquest in the Philippines. We saw the gorgeous Manila Cathedral and ended our day with a visit to Fort Santiago. And if you watch to the end of the video, you'll see a very interesting shot of a man rowing a boat with what we think was cardboard (I thought it was impressive :p)

Our First day in Philippines is finally here. We are in Manila and we will starting our journey around the Philippines from the capital city. We are currently staying in Makati, a popular area for tourists to stay in Manila. 
Visiting the Philippines has been on our travel bucket list for a long time so we are so excited to travel this fascinating country. Manila is a big bustling mega city offering some really unique sites. Already we are shocked by Manila. In this video we visit The Grand Venice Canal Mall, one of the many impressive malls in Philippines. We also got to try Jollibee, the Philippines popular fast food chain. We definitely needed to see what all the fuss was about. We also took a trip up to BGC, Manila's popular business district. Lastly we finished our first day in Philippines with a stunning sunset by Manila Bay. The perfect end to our first day in Philippines.

jJaymuewPYw,2023-08-23T12:47:00Z,UCKygRpISlqs5TufcT3JtRng,$20 First Class Bus (to Philippines Coldest City) 🇵🇭,"I was fed up of Manila's scorching heat so I boarded a bus out of town. My destination being the coldest city in the Philippines.

Baguio is known as the 'Summer Capital' of the Philippines and is very popular with domestic tourists looking for a break from the roasting hot weather in their own province.

There are direct buses running between Manila and Baguio very frequently, but there are different classes with different levels of comfort. Given that it was to be a 6 hour journey (depending on the traffic) I made sure to book the highest category of bus, 'First Class'.

There are many different bus companies in Luzon but I don't think there's much difference between them in terms of service and comfort. I chose to go with Victory Liner.

At the Victory Liner bus station in Pasay there's a dedicated waiting room for first class passenger. Nothing fancy, just some tea, coffee and a TV, but the main thing is the air conditioning. I was able to sit in comfort until the bus was ready to depart.

The first class bus has a 1-2 seating arrangement, so it's possible to book a seat alone without someone next to you. That's perfect for someone like me travelling solo. You don't want to be touching arms with a stranger for 6 hours like on some budget airline.

It didn't even take 6 hours though. The bus took ages to get out of Manila, due to the ridiculous traffic, but after that the roads were clear and we arrived in Baguio much sooner than I expected.

I thought the ticket price of 1,049 PHP ($18.63) was worth it for all the space I had, but other than that there's nothing fancy about the bus. No individual entertainment units, charging ports, anything like that.

The Victory Liner terminal in Baguio is located directly opposite a Jollibee restaurant so the first thing I did in Baguio was enjoy a delicious Double Yumburger.

I then checked in to the Orchard Hotel. It was the best hotel I could find in the central area of Baguio. There were some better hotels but they were in more remote areas.

My room at Orchard Hotel was hardly perfect, but the view from the balcony was awesome.

Getting close to sunset, I decided to visit the huge hangout area in the centre of Baguio called Burnham Park. There were loads of vendors selling ice cream and other treats, and a huge lake where people were enjoying boat rides.

So after enjoying a ""special"" strawberry ice cream, that I've no idea what was so special about it, I jumped on a pontoon and did a lap of the lake.

As the sun set, I got myself another sweet treat, a special ""Ice Scramble"" which is something like a Halo-halo and headed back to my hotel to enjoy a room service massage. Life is good.

mcWEmkXF4ik,2023-08-30T12:03:12Z,UCKygRpISlqs5TufcT3JtRng,"$0.25 Burger in Baguio, Philippines 🇵🇭","I explored the 'Summer Capital' of the Philippines. Baguio is a mountain city in Luzon that's very popular with domestic tourists looking for some fresher weather.

A cooler climate is exactly what I needed after suffering in the sweltering heat of Manila. After travelling to Baguio I can finally roam around outdoors for hours and feel good.

I started my day at the SM City. It's a huge modern mall built on top of a hill, with open walls to let the cool air flow through. It's the only major mall in the Philippines without air conditioning. AC simply isn't needed in Baguio.

At SM City Baguio, I enjoyed a combination of two of my favourite drinks, Milo and Boba Milk Tea from a stall called Tiger Sugar. I took my delicious drink to the sky terrace on the roof of the mall, that is a popular place to hang out and enjoy the weather and view of Baguio city.

I could see a Ferris wheel near the mall so went to check it out. It was in the Sky Ranch amusement park which has some other rides, but the only one that interested me was the pirate ship. It was fun but I wish there were some more thrill rides there.

From there I walked down Session Road, the main street in Baguio, to visit the public market. My mission was to buy some fresh strawberries, and that was an easy one to complete. Strawberries are very popular in Baguio as the area has the perfect climate to grow them.

At Baguio Public Market I also enjoyed some strawberry ice cream and some delicious Filipino sweets made from cassava and ube.

My final mission of the day was to buy a Baguio t-shirt and that was neither difficult of expensive.

With my missions complete I rewarded myself with a burger. I saw many people queuing up at a bakery where dozens of burgers were being fried up. No wonder they are popular as it must be the cheapest burger in the world, at only 15 pesos, or about $0.25. What a bargain!

The next day I continued the vlog by getting outside of Baguio city centre and visiting a cultural village at Mount Kalugong. The weather forecast was for heavy rain but I packed a poncho and visited anyway. The forecast is for rain every day, so you just need to take your chances.

After a short hike around the mountain and a bit of rock climbing, I was surprised to see there was a coffee shop up there. I don't like coffee but they had matcha green tea, which I love. So I got to enjoy a nice cold match Frappuccino with an incredible view of the La Trinidad area.

I visited Mr Kalugong by taxi but returned with the local transport, a jeepney. I've seen jeepneys everywhere since I arrived in the Philippines but had never actually ridden in one, so this was my first time.

I ended my Baguio adventure back where I began it, at the SM City Mall, where I enjoyed some special Japanese ramen and another bubble tea. Yum yum!

iXd277VEQuI,2023-11-12T10:12:58Z,UCKygRpISlqs5TufcT3JtRng,Random Filipina Wants to Massage Me in Bohol 🇵🇭,"I escaped the big city of Manila in the search for more tropical surroundings.

I'm not much of a beach person, so I researched to find an island that would have more to offer than just sunbathing and snorkeling. Bohol seemed like a good option, as it's is famous for its 'Chocolate Hills' - an amazing geological formation in the centre of the island. It would be a good place to rent a motorbike and explore.

On my first day, however I planned to enjoy the fancy beach resort that I'd booked at $250 USD per night.

I stayed at Henann Resort, which is beside Alona Beach in Panglao. Panglao is actually a separate, smaller island to Bohol, connected by a bridge but it's still part of the Bohol regency.

I was happy with my room, or ""suite"" they called it, at the Hennan hotel, other than the desk / chair set up that didn't have enough room for my legs. A common annoyance at hotels around the world. Who designs these things???

The hotel has many large pools and is right next to the beach, so plenty of swimming opportunities. That's what I was going to do, until I saw that kayaking was available. They were a special type of kayak called Crystal Kayaks that are totally see-through.  Perfect for kayaking in tropical waters.

I didn't see any tropical fish, kayaking so close to the beach, but I did see some cool looking crabs and some jellyfish.

After I worked up an appetite paddling around in the sea, I headed to the executive lounge to enjoy some snacks. As I'd paid for a suite, it included access to the Hennan lounge where food and drink is free.

I ended my first day in Bohol with a relaxing sunset beach massage. The lady who massaged me was strong and skilled, but then a random Filipina lady came by and asked if she could massage me instead. So random but so funny.

tYjJMG2m4kE,2023-11-19T10:35:28Z,UCKygRpISlqs5TufcT3JtRng,"Off The Beaten Path GOES WRONG in Bohol, Philippines 🇵🇭","I rented a motorbike so I could explore the Bohol island easily and in peace, without being stuck with a guide and driver.

There were many bike rental shops near my hotel, so I chose the one that had the best reviews on Google Maps. It cost 400 pesos ($7.20 USD) per day, while other shops were renting for 300 pesos per day, but their bikes were fairly new and in perfect condition, so it was worth paying the premium price.

For my first day of exploring I stayed in Panglao, which is the small island that's attached to the big Bohol island by a bridge.

Feeling hungry, I drove to Fortridge Food Park, which was highly rated on Google Maps, but when I got there it was dead. I think I was the only customer there and most restaurants were closed. So it seems like it's an evening place. Don't waste your time, like me, going there in the afternoon.

I ordered a fresh pineapple shake at Fortridge and then a huge thunderstorm started. So I took shelter there until it was dry, and continued my adventure.

I drove across Panglao to the Hinagdanan Cave, which is a popular tourist site in Bohol. It was way too busy though, with a queue of people waiting to get inside.

It was mostly local Filipino tourists who were visiting the cave. Bohol is a popular domestic tourist location, especially at the weekends. Filipinos living in Cebu can easily take a ferry across to Bohol for the weekend.

It was Sunday, and so I decided I'd leave and come back to the cave on a weekday.

It seemed like it was going to be a completely wasted day. With only a couple of hours of daylight left I tried to find something else interesting to visit in Panglao. I found there was seashell museum not too far away, and I could make it there just before they closed for the day.

The Nova Shell Museum in the Poblacion area of Panglao is one of the world's biggest sea shell collections in the world. I was lucky enough to go there when there were less visitors, so I got a  private tour of the collection from one of the knowledgeable guides there.

The next day started off rainy and I waited for a dry spell, so I could drive to Chocolate Hills on the main Bohol island.

I have access to the executive lounge at the Henann Alona Beach hotel where I'm staying, I so relaxed in there with some free snacks and drinks for a while.

Eventually the rain stopped and I started the 2 hour road trip to Bohol's Chocolate Hills. But on the way I stopped to visit the tarsiers.

Tarsiers are little monkeys and there's a big conservation area of them on the way to Chocolate Hills. They are nocturnal so they aren't moving around during the daytime but you can see them relaxing in the trees.

The other tourists I met at the the Bohol Tarsier Conservation Area were all heading to the Chocolate Hills viewpoint but I had a better idea. Rather than visit the tourist viewpoint, I found a place on Google Maps that said ""Chocolate Hill free view point.""

I reached the exact point on the map but there was nothing there, so I had to do a bit of exploring. I thought I found a path but that just led to me falling in a ditch and then discovering a locked gate.

After getting some help from the locals I eventually found my way up one of the chocolate hills, that I got to enjoy all by myself with no tourists to annoy me. Despite the mishap, it felt like a great success!

I looked for somewhere to enjoy some tasty Filipino food on my journey back to Panglao, and found a restaurant called ""Don Lechon."" Lechon is rotisserie pig - a food that I've been meaning to try since I got to the Philippines but haven't found the authentic one yet.

I thought I'd get the authentic pork lechon at Don Lechon, but it was only chicken. Apparently chicken can also be lechon.

On my last day in Bohol, before returning my scooter, I finally visited the Hinagdanan Cave and I have to say it was underwhelming. It's just a cave with a pool of water. It's cool to look at for a few seconds but that's it. Most people were there to swim, but I passed on that, as it didn't look clean.

I ended my Bohol adventure with a fruit smoothie, made by friendly local woman.

I recommend renting a motorbike if you visit Bohol. It was the best way to explore this amazing island.

A venit momentul sa ne luam ramas bun de la Filipine si sa imbratisam o noua tara, sa o cunoastem si sa o exploram. Pentru a face legatura intre insulele din Filipine si noua destinatie, mai intai trebuie sa petrecem o noapte si o jumatate de zi in Manila. Initial voiam sa alocam mai mult timp capitalei Filipinelor, insa ne-am documentat temeinic si am decis ca less is more 🙂 
Am aterizat seara din Bohol in Manila si inca de la aeroport am facut cunostinta cu stilul lor de pacalit turistii. Doi taximetristi ne-au cerut pe cursa pana in Makati, cartierul in care avem hotelul, de peste 10 ori pretul cursei. In aeroport exista o zona cu taxiuri autorizate si o domna care iti aproximeaza costul cursei, astfel incat soferul sa nu te pacaleasca. Credeti ca soferii tin cont de aceasta aproximare? Nu! 🙂 gasesc motive diverse pentru care vor creste costul cursei.
Am ajuns la hotel, camera este mica si stinghera, costul ei destul de mare, dar hotelul este pozitionat fix in centru Makati-ului, in zona de restaurante si cafenele. Am lasat bagajele si am iesit sa cautam un restaurant decent 🙂 cam greu, zicem noi. Am cutreierat stradutele pline de localnici, turisti si bisnitari. Un sentiment de frica mi-a paralizat mana pe geanta si ne-a marit pasul. Nu ne simteam in largul nostru, oamenii ne pareau ciudati si aveam impresia ca la orice colt de strada mai intunecat ne gasim nasul. Este primul oras care nu ne atrage si pe care nu ne dorim sa il descoperim. Ne da un sentiment de neliniste. Am gasit un restaurant ok-ish, mancam pe fuga si mergem repejor la culcare, maine vrem sa vedem daca ne schimbam parerea despre Manila.
De dimineata aveam mari dubii ca vrem sa exploram orasul, dar am decis sa vedem un parc, Alaya, care este o oaza de verdeata si liniste. Ne-am plimbat picioarele pana la un mall din apropiere, incadrat de un alt parc si ziua a trecut extrem de repede in aceste locuri unde ne-am simtit in  siguranta, datorita famiilor cu copii si atmosferei prietenoase. 
Manila este un oras al contrastelor, multa saracie dar si opulenta, al localnicilor care vor sa castige cat mai mult de pe urma turismului, al cluburilor de noapte din Makati, al femeilor care renunta la feminitate pentru un venit, al copiilor care dorm pe scari, al cladirilor pana la cer, al tranzitului din insulele filipineze spre alta tara.
Noi nu ne vom mai intoarce in Manila decat pentru a accesa insulele din Filipine,  care sunt un rai inca rustic al Asiei de Sud Est.

One community member even offered to show me her commute, so of course, I jumped at the opportunity.

At first I thought, oh yeah, everyone complains about their area's drivers, and the congestion is bad, and you know, here it's the worst. But after reading some reports, traffic in the Philippines, and especially Manila, really is some of the worst in the world.

I've filmed a lot about the Philippines, so I might be making 2-3 more videos, and perhaps one that talks specifically about Manila's Traffic problem.

What's the commute like where you're from?

In some places, like the famous BGC neighborhood, you can find glistening skyscrapers and ""first world"" amenities that could rival anywhere in the world.  And yet right next to it lies something very different.  

Over the years, I have seen the wildest most shocking things. Makati is no different.

If you visit, Filipinos will tell you to never go there, to never cross the boundaries that divide Makati to other cities. But I was curious.  Off the beaten path of P. Burgos Street, let's go see what this side of Makati is all about.

**This video is in no way intended to belittle or show disrespect toward the Filipino people and their culture.**


I hope you enjoy.

I visited Manila Bay one of the most crowded places in Manila, especially on Weekends. I also visited Mall of Asia which is one of the largest shopping malls not only in the Philippines but also in the entire Asian continent. despite all the places are crowded in Manila on weekends, people are very welcoming and friendly which is why the Philippines is one of the best places in Asia.

This was my first ride on a motorbike in Cebu, or ever in the Philippines for that matter, and my first impressions of riding a motorcycle there.   
Cebu Philippines, is a scary city in a lot of ways, and my first Impressions were that it was going to be difficult riding a Motorcycle there for the first time in the very busy and chaotic streets!

After being a bit nervous leaving my hotel car park I almost immediately felt at home again on a motorcycle seat riding through the crazy traffic, and it turned out to be one of the best adventure rides I have done so far on road. So I hope you enjoy the ride as much I did doing it. 
See you out there, and thanks for watching.

Welcome, and in this Philippines travel vlog, I will explore Albay Park & Wildlife and hike to the top of Ligñon Hill for an epic view of Legazpi City.

▶️ Please Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/@RobbieTravels

Today I visited Albay Park and Wildlife, a zoo park in Legazpi City, Philippines. The park is home to various animals, including tigers, lions, snakes, peacocks, and many more. The animals are  cared for by the City Veterinary Services. The park is safe, as most animals are housed in large cages where they can freely move around, some animal species aren't that lucky asI feltvery sad for the lion and the tiger.

In addition to seeing the animals, I also enjoyed spending time in the park's picnic grove. There are plenty of tables and benches where you can relax and enjoy a meal. There is also a playground for children and a fishing pond.

If you're looking for a fun and affordable way to spend a day in Legazpi City, I highly recommend visiting Albay Park and Wildlife.

After visiting Albay Park and Wildlife, I visited Ligñon Hill, another popular tourist destination in Legazpi City. Ligñon Hill is a 156-meter-high hill that offers stunning views of the city, Mayon Volcano, and Albay Bay.

There are a few different ways to get to the top of Ligñon Hill. You can walk, hike, or take a taxi. The hike is about 30 minutes long and is a quite steep climb. There seems to be a jeepney ride as well, but it can be quite crowded.

But I have decided to take a hike as it is a great way to exercise. Once I reached the top of the hill, I was amazed at the stunning views of the city, Mayon Volcano, and Albay Bay. There is a viewing platform to enjoy the views. Don't forget to bring your own refreshments because everything was closed at the top of Ligñon Hill.

Also, If you're feeling adventurous, try the 320-meter zip line from the top of the hill to the bottom. The zip line is a great way to get a bird's-eye view of the city and the surrounding area. Unfortunately the zip line was closed when we arrived there. I hope it was just a temporary closure.

I highly recommend visiting Ligñon Hill if you're looking for a fun and challenging activity. The views from the top of the hill are simply amazing.
So, watch the video till the end and don’t forget to share your thoughts in the comments.

Puerto Princesa, officially the City of Puerto Princesa, and often referred to as Puerto Princesa City, is a 1st class Highly Urbanized City in the Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 255,116 people.

It is a city located in the western province of Palawan, and westernmost city in the Philippines. Though the seat of government and capital for the province, the city itself is one of 38 independent cities within the Philippines not controlled by the province in which it is geographically located and is therefore an independent area located within Palawan.
