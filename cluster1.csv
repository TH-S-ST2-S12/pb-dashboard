A little bit about me..
Rebecca is a passionate Singer-Songwriter/Vocal coach/mentor /impressionist/photographer/creative junkie /self- development lover not a hater. 
 
“I want to motivate and inspire others to follow their dreams…corny? Well, maybe but it’s true. So what’s motivating me?? I had a huge tumour removed summer 2016.  However, despite not being able to walk for a few weeks, and feeling generally awful…. It has made me create and do what I love! It wasn’t an easy time but I won’t let fear dictate my life. I didn’t think ‘why me’, there are plenty of horrific issues people have to deal with…it’s not always smooth sailing.  It’s true when you hear, ‘Life is short’, the crazy thing is, I am glad it happened…I appreciate life even more and try to practice gratitude everyday…It’s so easy to get caught up with the little things…and I do sometimes, but look at the bigger picture, will it matter in a year or two…we are all specks of dust…Also, thank you for all your support. It means a lot. I have suffered from anxiety from the past and self-confidence, (yeah hard to see now right) didn’t think I was ‘good, or worthy enough’ but I feel I have a new lease of life, don’t really care as much and want to show you guys what I have! : ) You are all awesome and without you, there would be no channel.",Rebecca Vocal Athlete,"['rebecca vocal athlete', 'RVA Sings', 'Vocal Coach Reacts', 'Rebecca Vocal Athlete sings', 'Rebecca sings the Intros', 'reaction to filipino singers', 'nightwish', 'nightwish wembley', 'nightwish ghost love score', 'ghost adventures', 'vocal coach reacts to', 'reacts', 'rva', 'rebecca vocal athlete bts', 'rebecca vocal athlete reaction', 'heavy metal', 'live nightwish', 'how to sing']",en-GB,3162488,45272,0,6266,GB,React to Pinoy,Yes

ABOUT…
I am Rebecca and I am one heck of a passionate vocal coach/singer/songwriter/impressionist/health/fitness/self- improvement/anything that makes me smile!!  I love anything vocal/singing related and geek out on it every day.  I want to motivate and inspire others to follow their dreams…corny? Well maybe but it’s true. So what’s motivating me?? I had a huge tumour removed summer 2017 and my ovaries and fallopian tubes. The tumour was the size of a 20 week baby!!  However, despite not being able to walk for a couple of weeks, and feeling generally awful…. It has made me create and do what I love! It wasn’t an easy time but I won’t let fear dictate my life. I didn’t think ‘why me’, there are plenty of horrific issues people have to deal with…it’s not always smooth sailing.  It’s true when you hear, ‘Life is short’, the crazy thing is, I am glad it happened…I appreciate life even more and practice gratitude everyday…It’s so easy to get caught up with the little things…and I do sometimes, but look at the bigger picture, will it matter in a year or two…?

I jumped from TNT ""World's best"" performing ""Listen"" to this show directly so this was my first opinion, no reasons to be disappointed about it, because they NEVER disappoint me! 
I think they that even in a small room without lights they will shine with their voice, that was the meaning of my words 😉 
You smart people will understand it clearly!!

I love to watch details on stage and the producers of the show did a perfect job and in this video I was watching all performances for the first time ever without knowledge of the show I didn't expect it 😳 means as I said in the video that they are *born to be on stage* as performers too!!
🎙 !! That's It! 🎙
I also discovered they had to practice few hours a week for each night of the show 😱 And I Am keep thinking they are truly gifted 😍😍😍!! Tell more about the story behind them please!!

99% of my subscribers are sweet nice souls so :
*NO HATE* against singers or persons, religions, cultures, events ect 
IN THIS CHANNEL otherwise I will surely BAN the rude 1%"" 
Let's keep this space of internet a safe place 🙏🏼😍😍😍

ABOUT THE VOICE
The four-time Emmy Award-winning ""The Voice"" returns with the strongest vocalists from across the country invited to compete on the blockbuster vocal competition show's new season. EGOT winner and multi-talented musician, actor, singer and songwriter John Legend makes his debut as a coach this season. Coming off her second consecutive win on Season 15 - this time with a country artist - three-time Grammy Award winner and musical icon Kelly Clarkson returns alongside lovable veterans Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, as well as host Carson Daly. The show's innovative format features five stages of competition, beginning with the Blind Auditions, then the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, Playoffs and the Live Performance Shows.

So I never heard of SB19, I only seen their photos and I initially thought this group is another KPOP boy band but boy I was wrong! These 5 member act has the right skills in both dancing and singing and I feel that they're hitting the right marks to become the next big thing in Asia and the world!

I really enjoyed SB19 music and video production here!

Hop on!

On our way there, we randomly stopped by at this shop called Teology. It was great meeting employees who go out of their way to make customers feel at home.

Carcar is a beautiful place, and it's famous for its lechon, but I bought the twins and their family Jollibee instead since they're already in Carcar. I hope they enjoyed it.

Will Smith, Raffy Tulfo, and even Project Nightfall noticed Jake and Joemar's unique beatboxing skills and featured them on their social media channels. 

You can check their channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3lMCWI6Pjb0sd5r-yM4apQ

The twins started beatboxing at five (5) years old, and they only learned to do so by listening to disco music and the radio!

We spent the day with them, and during the interview, they shared their future plans with us. Joemar wants to have their own studio and finish his studies, and Jake wants to become a drummer and a mixer. 

In addition to their excellent and unique beatboxing skills, what really amazed me is that when they first started earning from their YouTube channel, they helped their relatives build their own house. What a selfless thing to do, right?

So we asked the twins what they would want to get for themselves. 

And guess what? Bicycles!

Watch the full video to learn their reaction when they found out we brought them bicycles.

Thank you for taking the time to watch. Take care!

Watch last week's episode where we bought the bikes and roamed around Cebu City:

SB19 is a five-member Filipino boy band that debuted in 2018, consisting of Josh, Pablo, Stell, Ken, and Justin. They were trained for three years by ShowBT Philippines, beginning in 2016. They are the first Filipino and Southeast Asian act to be nominated in Billboard Music Awards for the Top Social Artist category. They are also the first Southeast Asian act to enter the top 10 of Billboard Social 50 weekly and year-end charts. SB19 promotes its music as part of Pinoy pop (P-pop)—a popular sub-genre of Original Filipino Music. Let me know what other SB19 songs I should check out next. The most like comment I will do another SB19 reaction video to it.

not a lot of people know that when I performed this at the MOA Arena for The Coronation of 2022 Miss Universe Philippines, we didn't have our session in the studio yet since I literally had just come from the U.S for our recent tour. standard practice would be we'd record a song to also somewhat master the track first before even performing it live, but this was an exemption. it also took us a while after then to finally get back into the studio due to the somewhat return of ""normalcy"" nowadays and getting ourselves loaded with work. 

we initially already had a date to record this track with my Kuya Kikx, but I was feeling under the weather and caught the flu which also affected my voice so we had to postpone. weeks passed and on this day, I was in the studio with Dave working on some stuff when I randomly said, ""we should try to record 'Power' again."" mind you, we had other plans that evening but this was just a ""spur of the moment"" kind of thing. perks of having our own studio, he opens the session and this right here was our very first take. of course we did several more after that and finished in just around 20 minutes. I decided to shoot with my phone just for memories sake, but this turned out better than we thought.. and just wanted to share this with all of you ♡

*PLEASE NOTE THAT THE OFFICIAL VERSION IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S HEARD ON THIS VIDEO. this is just one take out of many we did that night, comped mixed and mastered for the best to be put out there. enjoy!

Their members are as follows:
Keifer Sanchez, born 25 November 2004 (age 14) in Davao City, Philippines
Mackie Empuerto, born 8 September 2005 (age 13) in Manila, Philippines
Francis Concepcion, born 22 June 2006 (age 12) in Zamboanga, Philippines

On June 10, 2017, the Tawag ng Tanghalan Kids (TNT Kids) grand finals was held at Resorts World Manila. John Clyd Talili emerged as the grand champion, while Keifer Sanchez was declared runner-up, Mackie Empuerto in third place, and Francis Concepcion in fifth.

Vice Ganda was instrumental in forming the trio when the boys guested on his show Gandang Gabi Vice just after the grand finals. Vice asked them to have a singing battle with Beyoncé's ""Listen"". The boys' performance in Gandang Gabi Vice received critical acclaim and went viral on social media, with reaction videos from netizens praising their singing ability. There and then, Vice launched the kids as the TNT Boys.

That was the start of the TNT boys. They went on to do many other accomplishments:
Little Big Shots
Your Face Sounds Familiar Kids
President's Star Charity event
The Big Shot Concert' at the Araneta Coliseum
The World's Best

Awards: 
On November 14, 2018, the boys received the Royal Cub Award at the Rawr Awards 2018 from the entertainment blog

On November 29, 2018, they became recipients of the Rising Pop Child Performer of the Year Award at the PPOP Awards for Young Artists 2018.

Watch as I react to the TNT Boys together for the first time on GGV, doing a battle with “Listen” that would go on to form the TNT Boys. See how it all came together.  

This video they start their group as TNT Boys this video has gone viral and become popular around the world. ""Tawag ng Tanghalan"" (TNT) where their name as a group was derived...the little girl is Sheena Bellarmino.

The fourth boy, John Clyde, was the grand winner of the TNT Kids singing competition where Kiefer, Mackey, and Francis ended up as runner ups. He was supposed to join them- as all four of them were guests in the show after the competition- but he was sick at the time of guesting, so the host Vice Ganda thoughtfully set him aside (for him to rest for a while) in this mock singing battle. Clyde though was eager to take part in the singing as he asked the host- ""What about me?"" 

In this video, I examine TNT Boys the beginning ggv reaction.

QFTD: Who do you think won the Battle? Leave your comments for me in the comments section of this video. And remember to like share and subscribe.

The long awaited video you've all been asking for!
I am so sorry that it took me this long to react.
A while ago I posted a video saying that I didn't enjoy reacting anymore, and now that I've had some time off, I wanted to come back and react to my most requested video!

I'll only be reacting to KPOP music videos in the future, 
but I genuinely want to thank everyone who requested this video, even if your comment was not shown in the video.

I hope you enjoy my reaction, thank you again!

I heard an old, old story,
How a Savior came from glory,
How He gave His life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me;
I heard about His groaning,
Of His precious blood's atoning,
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory. 

O victory in Jesus,
My Savior, forever.
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the cleansing flood. 

I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing pow'r revealing.
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see;
And then I cried, ""Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit,""
And somehow Jesus came and bro't
To me the victory. 

O victory in Jesus,
My Savior, forever.
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the cleansing flood. 

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory.
And I heard about the streets of gold
Beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I'll sing up there
The song of victory. 

O victory in Jesus,
My Savior, forever.
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the cleansing flood.",Gospel Light Filipino,"['Victory', 'Jesus', 'GLCC Filipino', 'Gospel', 'Victory in Jesus']",en,95,3,0,0,SG,Love Filipino,Yes
