From Balyudong :

1,400 Filipino soldiers versus 40,000 communist Chinese

They faced 40,000 Chinese soldiers with only rifles, machine guns, mortars and howitzers to stop the enemy. They also have 2 light tanks, a few bazookas which didn't work and not of all them had winter clothing. The communist attack was so overwhelming that the British and the Puerto Ricans retreated but the Filipinos stayed and kept fighting.

They were greatly outnumbered 40 to 1 so the clerks, drivers and cooks joined the fight. They held the line, preventing the Chinese to take more land from Korea. The Chinese army lost 7,000 troops while the Filipinos lost 24 with 26 more wounded.

When the Americans came there were a lot of littered clothing all over the area. An American officer asked a Filipino machine gunner what those ""rags"" were. He replied, ""Those are dead Reds, sir"".

The Korean War (25 June 1950 -- 27 July 1953) was a war between the Republic of Korea (South Korea), supported by the United Nations, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), at one time supported by the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. It was primarily the result of the political division of Korea by an agreement of the victorious Allies at the conclusion of the Pacific War at the end of World War II. The Korean Peninsula was ruled by the Empire of Japan from 1910 until the end of World War II. Following the surrender of the Empire of Japan in September 1945, American administrators divided the peninsula along the 38th parallel, with U.S. military forces occupying the southern half and Soviet military forces occupying the northern half. (Wikipedia)

The Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea (PEFTOK) was the Philippine Army contingent of the United Nations forces that fought in the Korean War. The unit arrived in Korea in August 1950. It was composed of 7,500 Filipino soldiers, and was the fourth largest force under the United Nations Command.

The PEFTOK took part in the Battle of Yultong Bridge and the Battle of Hill Eerie. The unit operated with the United States 1st Cavalry Division, 3rd Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, and 45th Infantry Division. Among the Filipino soldiers who fought during the Korean war was 2nd Lt. Fidel Ramos who would later become president of the Philippines.

What happens to democracy when press freedom is threatened and disinformation flourishes on social media? In “A Thousand Cuts,” award-winning filmmaker Ramona Diaz tells the story of President Duterte’s crackdown on the press, his pursuit of Ressa and her colleagues, the role of online disinformation, and the implications for democracy.

In the wake of the debut of “A Thousand Cuts” at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, The New York Times called it “absorbing” (Critic’s Pick); The Washington Post said it is “utterly urgent”; and The Hollywood Reporter described it as “essential.”

Nerissa and Gabriel Roque sustained multiple injuries from the incident,  including a broken rib. Weber was charged with felony battery causing serious bodily injury for the attack on Gabriel Roque and felony battery for the attack on Nerissa Roque. Both counts carried hate crime enhancements.
Months after seeking support from government entities, the family hasn’t received any victim compensation or material support.
A date for the preliminary hearing has finally been set after being pushed back constantly for months. If there is no date set, the case would get dismissed; which is why we need to #PackTheCourtroom on this day to pressure the courts to choose a date. 

Monday, March 6, 2023
Time: 8:30am
Van Nuys Courthouse West
14400 Erwin Street Mall
Van Nuys, CA 91401

Asian Hate is on trial in the courts - if this case is dismissed, considering there is a video of the entire incident, this could set a precedent that would not only impact Filipino Americans but Asian Americans. If you can’t support the Roques with your physical presence, consider donating to the #JusticeforRoques campaign at https://bit.ly/justiceforroque1D .

TN7lweGEmuk,2023-08-31T09:00:08Z,UCLvnKTwSZEnCbTHNnqiivRQ,Life After WAR in the Philippines (Marawi) 🇵🇭,"Today we walk through the war torn city of Marawi, Philippines. In 2017 ISIS attacked the city of Marawi in order to expand their influence in Southeast Asia. The tragic ISIS siege destroyed the entire city, lives were lost and people lost hope and trust. Now we are going on an emotional journey to see how this city is transforming, from ruins to a university city, embracing its past and looking towards the future. We are going to listen to Marawi war survivors stories, highlighting the importance of compassion, community and strength.

Thanks to Yusuph and his friends for your wonderful hospitality.

Drop us a mail at dodoexplorersblog@gmail.com and we will guide you with step by step instructions. All donations will be collected and sent to our local contact in Marawi, helping them with local community projects.

Eric was rushed to the hospital immediately and was pronounced dead on arrival.  And so a tragic story we have an American expat coming to bring home an adopted son.

Shotdown outside of a bar.  So his wife Vicky heard the news and she was upset, took it very very hard.  But she still wants to proceed with the adoption of Jeremiah.

This is a continuation of our series on Crime in the Philippines  So today we’re talking about the case of Eric Hendrickson.

Eric was a 57-year-old American. He was born and raised in the midwest.

Eric grew up and had a successful career in business.
He married a Filipina.

His wife name was Vicky and they've been married over 20 years. They had no children and Vicky was from Silay City Negros Occidental area.

Eric and Vicky went home one time.  For a visit and they met a young boy. They fell in love with him.  His name was  Jeremiah.   
.
So their goal that point forward was to adopt Jeremih and bring him back to the United States to live.

Eric was so excited he left his job and went to the Philippines to begin paperwork to bring Jeremiah back to the United States.

Vicky stayed behind in Iowa.  And it was a very peaceful and happy time for the family.

So as time went on Eric got news from the adoption authorities.

That he would be able to bring Jeremiah home in March.

Because paperwork was a little bit delayed but he was happy about it,

After a long day, you went to a bar and ordered a beer.  He that down was enjoying his beer and all of a sudden, two guys, two Filipinos come in.

And they interrupted him and said hey, buy us a beer..  Eric was taken aback.  He was like wait a minute guys, I don’t know you and you want me to buy you a beer? No, I’m not going to do it.

I’m sorry I’m not. I don’t know you guys.

So the Filipinos became very irate and disgruntled about it.  And so they started talking and cussing Eric out in their native tongue.  And Eric knew the language.  His wife had taught him the language. 

So he knew exactly what they were saying.  And he knew exactly what they were talking about.

They were calling him all sorts of names, all sorts of names under the sun.

So Eric retaliated with some words of his own.  And they had a very heated discussion,

So Eric’s niece Ms. Nemec started a GOFUNDME account.  They need about $15,000 dollars, to bring Jeremiah to Vicky in the United States. And also to bring the body of Eric back to Iowa to be buried,.and proceed with the adoption of Jeremiah as well.

So for those of you that are interested in donating, that would be a good thing to do.  Here is the link to the GOFUNDME account https://www.gofundme.com/ErikHendrickson

So the moral of this story, what can we learn from it?  Basically, as I’ve repeated over and over in many of these crime videos.    

When we cause a Filipino to lose face,  The situation can become very volatile.  Anything can happen.  

Now the two men were a 40-year-old Filipino and his 18-year-old nephew and they were apprehended very very quickly.

They’re in jail.  They’re in custody and they’re going to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  

I want to know your thoughts. Put them in the comments section of this video.  

An American expat  killed in Silay City Philippines 

Question of the day.  What are your thoughts on this story as it relates to violence.? What kind of violence have you seen in the Philippines?
I want to know your thoughts. Put them in the comments section of this video.  And remember to like share and subscribe.

During a speech on Saturday, Trump recounted conversations with Chinese and Singaporean leaders who, he said, solved their countries’ drug problems by executing drug traffickers. Trump has also repeatedly expressed admiration for Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and said he’s done an “unbelievable job on the drug problem.” Last month, the International Criminal Court opened a preliminary investigation into accusations that Duterte had committed crimes against humanity by overseeing the killing of up to 8,000 people in his so-called war on drugs. We speak to Widney Brown, the managing director of policy at the Drug Policy Alliance.

This comes as a transcript of the call of Trump praising Duterte for his controversial drug war was leaked and published by The Intercept. According to the leaked transcript, Trump said, ""I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem. Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing, and I just wanted to call and tell you that."" Duterte’s bloody war on drugs has led to the deaths of nearly 9,000 people, most of whom are poor. Human rights groups have blasted Duterte for the way he’s waged his anti-drug campaign, defined by extrajudicial killings of thousands of suspected drug dealers and users. For more on Trump and Duterte, we speak to Jeremy Scahill, co-founder of The Intercept and host of the new weekly podcast, ""Intercepted."" Scahill recently co-wrote a three-part series on the leaked call for The Intercept.

About Moon Knight (2022) (Source Disney+):

When Steven Grant, a mild-mannered gift-shop employee, becomes plagued with blackouts and memories of another life, he discovers he has dissociative identity disorder and shares a body with mercenary Marc Spector. As Steven/Marc's enemies converge upon them, they must
navigate their complex identities while thrust into a dangerous mystery among the powerful gods of Egypt.

About the Character: (source Wikipedia):

Actor Oscar Isaac plays the following characters: Marc Spector / Moon Knight, Steven Grant / Mr. Knight, and Jake Lockley:

Marc Spector is a Jewish-American mercenary who becomes, Moon Knight, the avatar for the Egyptian moon god Khonshu. Isaac used his own American accent for Spector. Executive producer Kevin Feige described Spector as a ""brutal"" action hero.

Steven Grant is a mild-mannered British gift-shop employee who becomes Mr. Knight, Grant's persona when he is Khonshu's avatar. Isaac put on a London English accent for Grant that he suggested was intentionally ""bizarre"" and unconvincing. Grant has tension with Spector when the two personalities first become aware of each other Mr. Knight uses Grant's knowledge of ancient Egypt to help get out of conflicts with wits and puzzle solving, which is a contrast to Spector's Moon Knight persona.  

Jake Lockley is a third, more ruthless alter. Lockley speaks in Spanish, with Isaac enjoying being able to bring that element of his own life to the role instead of just ""trying to pay service to some idea that was in the comics"". Isaac noted Lockley has something ""ominous about him"" and more control than Spector or Grant.
