After making a travel vlog about the Giant Clams Sanctuary with my friend Aitz, I set my sights on the Sunken Cemetery. As a foreigner in the Philippines, this was amazing travel vlog material.

The sunken cemetery fell into the ocean with the 1871 eruption of Mount Vulcan. It was built by the spanish, and has seen a lot of destruction over the years. More eruptions, typhoons, and tsunamis have turned this beautiful graveyard into rubble, leaving only a few relics under water.

This Philippines travel vlog was recorded after leaving my expat friends Kulas of Becoming Filipino, Daniel Marsh, Finnsnow, Bret Maverick, and the fighterboys in Cagayan de Oro, CDO, and continuing for a mini adventure in Northern Mindanao

After travelling as a foreigner in the Philippines for many months, I've been all over the country making travel vlogs. It really is a dream destination, but there's so much more to see than the beaches!

While I have been island hopping in Coron to visit kayangan lake, twin lagoon, and nacpan beach by el nido in Palawan. My mission was always to find what else was there.

I've avoided places like Siargao and Boracay. I'm sure they are some of the most beautiful places in the Philippines, but I've always felt they were not the best places to se Filipino culture.

This is a sort of Travel Guide for the Philippines. For people who like to get off the beaten path, and love adventure travel. 

These are my top 10 favourite destinations in the Philippines so far.

1. Apo Whang-Od 
The last mambabatok doing traditional Kalinga tattoos. Shes 102 years old and a legend in the Philippines. https://youtu.be/Ivn4-GzrETM

2. Blue Soil Hills
The rainbow mountain of the Philippines. There is blue soil just outside of Sagada in Northern Luzon. It's incredible to see. https://youtu.be/h1rfNMyUG0Q

3. The Hanging Coffins
Echo Valley is a very famous place to see the Hanging coffins. There are many better places however, you just have to ask.
https://youtu.be/p9vyz_HYKZM

4. The Sunken Cemetery
Just off the coast of Camiguin island there is a Giant Cross standing out in the ocean. Surrounding it is a cemetery sunk by a volcano. Only in the Philippines... https://youtu.be/lPCnUCvh-pg

5. Warship Graveyard of Coron
While many go island hopping in Coron, there is another adventure under the waves. Giant Japanese warships are sunk, and ready to explore for advanced Scuba Divers.
https://youtu.be/ZVa1bOwyprA

6. Britania Islands
Just below Siargao in Mindanao, in Surigao del Sur, you can find these magnificent islands. Very few people venture this far. https://youtu.be/CgyE2DyVppg

7. Matigol Falls
Easily one of the most amazing waterfalls in the Philippines, and unknown to tourism outside of Mindanao. This waterfall was ""The one that got away"" https://youtu.be/FDre4ptJPiU

8. Bulingan Falls
A stepping stone Columnar Basalt waterfall on Basilan, Mindanao. There can't be very many of these on planet earth. https://youtu.be/A8UANZdETHU

9. Torpedo Boats
Illegal logging boats are now being used to shoot thrill seeking tourists up rivers in Northen Samar.
https://youtu.be/K03sxDaJSHU

10. Filipino Food.
Food in the Philippines has a bad repuatation. Most of it is quite tasty, even if it doesn't appeal to the western Palette. Especially the street food! https://youtu.be/PVEeScXdSVU

In this travel vlog I join Exploring with Cody in a Filipino adventure to visit Kayangan Lake, Twin Lagoon, Barracuda lake, and Skeleton Wreck. These incredible islands have been called the most beautiful in the world. If you plan to travel South East Asia, this has to be on your bucket list. It is definitely one of the best places to travel in the Philippines

We had a couple days between scuba diving the shipwrecks of Coron Bay, and exploring El Nido, Palawan. We decided to spend it Island hopping in Coron with our friend Jette. We wanted to do the tour a little bit differently, so we organized a private boat for us three, and left an hour earlier than other boats. This paid off in the end, because these islands are getting very very busy, and we were able to miss most of the crowds.

This is why we love the PHILIPPINES!  Needless to say there are so many destinations in the Philippines to visit and we haven't seen many at all yet BUT this a great starting point for someone wanting to visit this paradise!  We have traveled a lot through Southeast Asia and so far the Philippines has the most crystal clear water.  If anyone knows us you will know we are suckers for some turquoise water!  If we can swim, snorkel and dive every day we will!  There are endless adventures to go on-sometimes travel days bring on their own types of adventures.  Some of our kids fondest memories are from the Philippines, thats why we are going BACK!!!  Maybe for a while we aren't sure yet.  We have so much more exploring to do.  We put a shout-out to the local Filipinos to see what are some hidden gems and must see spots that we should go check out and we got thousands of recommendations so we are going to take them on.  

Get ready for a ton PHILIPPINES videos!

Oslob, Philippines was quite the adventure!  We wanted to find out if this town offered more than the whale sharks.  Well it did:)  We took a boat ride from Oslob over to Sumilon Island and it was beautiful.  It is always exciting when taking boat tours because they have the most creative ways of getting on and off the boats.  Either you walk from boat to boat as a way to the shore or different size planks-they always seem to get smaller and smaller-YIKES!  The boat ride itself was a little sketchy but we made it in one piece.  We did the whale shark tour and got to experience these amazing creatures they are serious gentle giants.  We have a video that we did of just the whale shark tour-we would not do that tour again though since they are feeding the whale sharks.  These beautiful babies should be feeding themselves in the ocean and not used as a tourist attraction:(  There is definitely controversy surrounding these tours.

Little did I know that i will end up visiting a Filipino water village on one of these islands. What a cool and unique experience here in Sabah Malaysia!

What's the first place that comes to your mind when you think of the Philippines? It's most likely a beautiful beach or some places with crystal clear water. In Coron, Palawan in the Philippines you can find exactly that. Coron is one of the most popular places to visit in the Philippines and therefore super famous. Usually I try to avoid super touristy places, but Coron is a place you have to see when visiting the Philippines. My German friend Roman joined me and we booked a private boat tour to some of the best spots Coron has to offer. Join us on the day out here to see some of the most beautiful places I have ever seen!

If you want to to Coron island hopping as well, I booked this tour here:

Palawan has been repeatedly crowned the most beautiful island in the world and the little town of El Nido is its crown jewel. One of the best and most popular things to do in El Nido is island hopping. Every morning you can get a boat from the main beach in El Nido that will take you on an island tour. You can choose from about 4 different tours. 
The tour that me and my friends chose took us to Helicopter Beach, a white sand beach on a small island that got us warmed up for the rest. Next was Hidden Beach. Named so because you can't see it from the ocean because it is hiding behind a large rock wall. Next was lunch so we were driven to the other side of Matinloc Island to a tiny but stunning beach at the foot of the karsts. Snorkeling was amazing here because of the bright coral, sealife and a Finding Nemo-esque dropoff. I even saw a couple clownfish living in an anemone. After a delicious lunch we went to Secret Beach. It is a beach completely surrounded by rock walls and the only way to get to it is to swim through a hole in the wall. To finish up, our guides took us to the best spot I have ever snorkeled. Teeming with coral, fish, and beautiful clear water. Seeing the rainbow on the way back to town was the cherry on top of this awesome experience.

It was an afternoon excursion from our hotel in Coron and 726 steps to the top to watch the sunset.

We didn't stick around to watch the sunset so we beat the rush.

I flew the drone from the top of Mt Tapyas and got some awesome drone footage which I hope you like.

Exploring Panglao + Alona Beach 🏝,"We've made our way to Panglao which is part of the island of Bohol in the Philippines. Panglao is famous for its many beautiful beaches and it certainly didn't disappoint. In this video we're at one of the most beautiful beaches we've seen in the Philippines called Dumaluan Beach. We're spending the day at South Palms Beach Panglao where we have lunch. 

We also take you back to our apartment rental for a tour of where we're staying and later to Alona Beach for an incredible sunset. 

Throughout the video we talk about the fact that we made a mistake here in the Philippines!

The next one in our travel vlog series is Malcapuya Island Philippines (a Coron Island vlog).  This was all part of a Coron Island Hopping tour which we did two of just to cover all the spots we wanted to visit.

Malcapuya Island Coron was definitely one of the highlights of our recent Coron trip. We have been to a lot of beaches and nothing compares to the famous Boracay white sand until we explored this island.

Explore Malcapuya Island Coron Palawan | Malcapuya Island Tour Experience | Philippine Beaches 2019

It is located 2 hours away from the town of Coron. Most tour groups around town offer packages going to Malcapuya Island. It is usually packaged with Bulog Dos and Banana Island.

The boat ride to this island can be a little rough because of the strong waves but it’s definitely worth it. The boats will dock at the back beach which is not as nice as the main beach. A short walk will lead you to the white sand beach facing west. Among all the beaches we have visited so far, Malcapuya’s sand rivals Boracay’s. It is as white and as powdery as the one in White Beach, Boracay.

Like, comment, and subscribe so that this episode gets maximum reach 👍🏼

After spending several days each in Singapore, and then Manila and Coron Island in the Philippines, we’re swapping the adventure of private lagoon houseboat life for the luxurious resort life of Boracay. This 10-square-mile hotspot was named the best island in the world by Travel + Leisure magazine thanks to its white sand beaches, world-class coral and shipwreck diving, and a reputation for being one of the world's top destinations for relaxation. But before we can put feel the sand in our toes, we have to get there—and that means leaving our current paradise behind.

Besides being known for its white sand beaches, coral reefs, shipwrecks, and nightlife, this tiny, 10 square mile island is also famous for being one of the world's top destinations for relaxation. That helps explain the modern and luxurious resorts that dominate the coasts.

In addition to the Travel + Leisure review, Boracay made the magazine’s Readers Choice top list. It was also at the top of the ""Best Islands in the World"" list by Condé Nast Traveler and headed that magazine's list of ""Top 10 destinations to watch.”

ABOUT US.

We’re the Lockwoods: a family with 3 kids, 5 careers, and endless passion for adventure. Two years ago, we decided it was time for Phil's ad agency to abandon the in-person, 5-day workweek. So they 86’d the office and work hours, allowing our own family to start traveling almost constantly. We now work, school, and explore in a different place every week—from our own mountain and beach homes to exotic villas, resorts, and yachts around the world. As we experience and support diverse cultures, we hope to inspire more families to design a life of freedom and adventure.

We’re on the penultimate location in our 3-week, Southeast Asia trip and that has us here in Panglao.

ABOUT US.

We’re the Lockwoods: a family with 3 kids, 5 careers, and endless passion for adventure. Two years ago, we decided it was time for Phil's ad agency to abandon the in-person, 5-day workweek. So they 86’d the office and work hours, allowing our own family to start traveling almost constantly. We now work, school, and explore in a different place every week—from our own mountain and beach homes to exotic villas, resorts, and yachts around the world. As we experience and support diverse cultures, we hope to inspire more families to design a life of freedom and adventure.

Because there’s a new American Dream. It’s one that’s void of templated expectations, templated career paths, templated education, templated families, templated homes, and templated lives. Freedom is no longer an American tagline—it’s just the new, global way of life.

Like, comment, and subscribe so that this episode gets maximum reach 👍🏼

We’ve left the hustle and bustle of BGC Manila and flown down to the beach city of Donsol, where we’re hoping to catch a glimpse of the glowing trees of fireflies and cash in a raincheck for swimming with the majestic whale sharks of the Philippines. But speaking of rain, we’ve had constant showers since stepping off the plane last night, so we’re hoping to attract a little luck this morning while we wait for our guide.

We had a whale shark excursion booked in the south of Cebu, but after doing a little research on the most ethical ways to interact with these gentle giants, we decided to cancel that opportunity and instead spend the day searching for the most adventurous street foods in Cebu City.

As much as we love the idea of hugging baby penguins and as much as Colt likes catching lizards, as a general rule, we respect the mentality of observing nature instead of interfering with it. Other dive sites attract whale sharks by chumming the water, which creates an unnatural dependencies. Here in Donsol, these activities are done right, which can mean less reliability that you’ll encounter any of them but when you do, you know that you’re doing much less to disturb their existence.

We’ve been unlucky with the weather so far (the rain has followed us around), but that didn’t stop us from booking an epic private boat trip from Panglao island to see some gorgeous sights! WE WERE SO LUCKY. As we set off on the boat trip, the rain didn’t peak out once - to add to the amazing day, it started with some dolphin spotting! Things just got better from there, too! The Philippines truly have some beautiful sights and amazing animals to be seen! What a brilliant boat trip from Panglao, Bohol, here in the Philippines.

►https://www.skool.com/cydschool/about

Bohol, Philippines ➖ I arrived in Bohol yesterday by ferry and checked into this $200 luxury hotel. At the time of checking in, it was classic Filipino rainy season weather, so I waited till the morning to share with you this luxury hotel experience. I couldn’t have asked for a better day weather-wise, as well as the exciting activities we got up to.

We started the day off with a quick swim in the infinity pool overlooking the ocean, and of course, had to enjoy the view with a margarita in the pool. I then showed you guys the room and facilities of the hotel, before heading out onto the private beach and doing all the fun activities there. I love the ocean, and when you have a 5-star hotel right by the water like this one, I don’t think there are any places I’d rather be.

El Nido, Philippines ➖ The most recommended thing to do here in El Nido is an island hopping tour. So my dad and I decided to rent out a boat for $220 and go on an exciting day trip around the islands
The tour began at 8am as we set out from the main port of El Nido. Along the way, we were able to take in the breathtaking views of the different islands and admire the crystal blue waters. We stopped at some of the many small islands and beaches where we got to swim, snorkel and explore the unique ecosystems of the area. We then enjoyed red horse, coconuts and lunch on one of the islands before getting home before the weather turned!

El Nido Tour A included 5 stops: The big and small lagoons, the secret lagoon, snorkeling spot, Seven Commandos or Papaya Beach, and Shimizu Island. 

A private tour really helps takes things to a different level, as we loved the big lagoon, and had a blast kayaking through It since we went there first to avoid other tours. We had the secret lagoon and Papaya Beach at Seven Commandos Beach all to ourselves for a good few minutes, which would not have been possible on a group tour. 

El Nido, Palawan is often referred to as the MOST BEAUTIFUL place in not just the Philippines, but  the whole world and is known for its world-famous island hopping tours and after experience it ourselves, we can definitely see why.

Bohol, Philippines is known for some incredible scenery like chocolate hills, tarsiers, and stunning beaches and we were really excited to check them all out. 

We leave our friends Greg and Jumi @FoodandFootprints in Cebu as we take off to Panglao Island in Bohol, Philippines to our ultimate destination at Alona Beach where we got to spend a little bit over 24 hours enjoying a long holiday weekend with locals! 

We even got to try out some new Filipino food, including seafood, and drink some delicious Calamansi Juice while escaping the hot sun on Panglao Island.

From here we went snorkelling in Moalboal to try and see the famous sardine run. This built up our appetite so Andrew and good friend Chili set off to try the elusive Balut.

The next day we set off to the incredible Binalayan hidden falls where Andrew went cliff jumping for the first time in his life.

We are Eleise and Lawrence & Nyh – A young family from the south of England. Like many people the pandemic gave us a shake up! While watching hours of Mark Weins in Thailand – We had our “Ah ha” Moment. We decided we wanted to travel.
Enjoying working for ourselves, we didn’t want to give up our business and decided it was entirely possible for us to do both. So we set about making it our lifestyle to work in the UK for a month, and then travel for a month – month on, month off…. until our little boy Nyh goes to school! We want to inspire people that you don’t have to up-sticks, sell all your belongings and leave behind family to be able to see the world.

Our Philosophy. Work, Travel, Repeat.

kdQjdQUFzBo,2023-06-17T11:00:29Z,UCguRKiLcbY9yIG9fxmd9BuQ,"Exploring Boracay, the Philippines Most Popular Vacation Destination","Borocay Island in the Philippines is one of the top destinations for anyone traveling to the Philippines. It is also a super popular vacation destination for local Filipinos as it is only a 30 minute flight from Manila! BUT, Boracay Island also has a reputation for being so busy that you can't actually enjoy the beach or water. If you caught our last video, you know that getting here was an adventure in itself. We were worried that Boracay wouldn't be worth all the time and coordination it took to get here (if you missed our last video about traveling to Boracay, you can watch it here: https://youtu.be/dybMr5LpKOU).

Boracay is most famous for it's extremely long and beautiful beach which is aptly named White Beach. The sand on White Beach is fine and soft and the beach seems to go on forever (we never did find the end of it!). All along White Beach there are restaurants, bars, shops, and activity centers where tourists can eat or shop while looking out onto the ocean. Boracay is divided into Stations (Station 1, 2, and 3) which are kind of like neighborhoods, and no matter which Station your hotel is located in, you'll be able to walk to the beach and all the beachfront shops. The nearness of the beach to all of the tourist attractions is definitely one of the biggest benefits to visiting Boracay Island!

If you're visiting Boracay, there are tons of awesome water activities that you can do from White Beach. We chose two of the most popular ones - crystal kayaking and parasailing! We honestly thought the crystal kayak would be kind of lame, but we had a lot of fun floating on the water while somehow seeing the bottom of the ocean! And the thrill of parasailing probably doesn't need to be explained - just watch the video for some good laughs at the hilarious Insta 360 footage we captured while hanging in the sky :)

At the end of the video we will tell you whether or not we feel Boracay is worth traveling to in 2023. Although we only show one day in this video, we actually spend 5 in Boracay and were able to get a pretty good feel for it! It is definitely a very touristy place and has a much more resorty vibe than we were used to in El Nido, but you'll have to watch the video for our full thoughts!

It’s risk free with Nord’s 30 day money-back guarantee! Use our code 'nicoleandmico' for your 4 extra months!

We have fallen in love with El Nido! Located in Palawan, Philippines, this beach destination MUST be on your travel itinerary for the Philippines. In this video we share the best things to do in 2 days in El Nido. We hope you are visiting El Nido for longer than 2 days (in our opinion, you should stay for 4 if you're on holiday), and if so, then you can sprinkle a little more beach hopping and scuba diving into this itinerary than we've shown here.

There is lots of debate over which island hopping tour in El Nido is best, but we truly don't think you can choose wrong! We took Island Hopping Tour C with Umi Travels and Tours (https://www.facebook.com/umitours/) and loved the islands we visited. Tour C had such diversity to the various stops we made during the day and we were really happy with our choice. We have bee blown away by the landscapes of the Philippines since we arrived and Tour C did a great job of showing that off.

There are many other beautiful beaches near El Nido town including Corong Corong and Vanilla Beach, but our favourite is Nacpan Beach. It takes about 30 minutes by scooter, but the drive is beautiful and you can easily spend an entire day at Nacpan! They have awesome FIlipino food  for a really affordable price (we recommend trying pancit!) as well as a high-end restaurant and cafe as well if you're feeling like luxury. 

In this El Nido travel guide we also include recommendations for where to stay, where to scuba dive, where to eat, and where to find awesome night life in El Nido town! We actually spent a total of 3 weeks in El Nido, so we had lots of time to explore this amazing beach town and can confidently say it is one of our favourites in the world! If you are heading to El Nido soon and are looking for a fun hostel to stay at, we can recommend Frendz Hostel: https://hostelworld.tp.st/TKL9bHDu

To make the most of our first time in Palawan, we found ourselves a beautiful Air Bnb to really rest and relax in that is right on the beach. We are staying in Busuanga, Palawan, which is near to Coron and Coron Island (don't worry, we'll be visiting Coron as well!). We chose to stay in Busuanga in the North of Palawan because of the luxury Air Bnb that is really secluded and has direct access to the beach as well as a private pool for the property! 

Palawan is so famous because it is said to have many of the best beaches in the Philippines, and in today's video we wanted to see if that was true for ourselves. We boarded a boat right from the beach at our luxury air bnb and spent the day touring two nearby islands that are rarely visited by foreigners. The only other tourists we saw on the islands were local Filipinos who were on holiday from nearby cities. 

As it turns out, the beaches on Palawan Island, Philippines are as incredible as everyone says they are! We don't yet know if these are the best beaches in the Philippines, but we were blown away by the incredible views we had of the beaches and also of the sea life that we could see snorkeling right from the beach. Bringing my parents here for their holiday in the Philippines is so special. Palawan has turned out to be such a beautiful place to go on vacation with family, and we are so lucky to be sharing our experiences here with my parents!

ITS GONE WRONG IN THE PHILIPPINES. We definitely didn't expect this in the Philippines. In this video we explain the previous few days as The Philippines received the tail end of a typhoon. Are we in the Philippines at the wrong time?  This was going through our heads. The typhoon led to Ferry cancelations and a lot of rain. We were stuck in El Nido waiting for our Ferry to Coron Island. We waited 5 days for the rain to stop and the ferries to run again. Unfortunately for us, we already had our flight booked from Coron to Cebu. Which each day that went passed we were unsure if we would actually make it. Watch till the end to see exactly how it all panned out for us here in The Philippines.

This is why you visit the Philippines. The number one thing to do in the Philippines is Island Hopping. This is our first time to do island hopping in the Philippines and we were so excited. The Philippines has some of the best beaches in the world and we can definitely agree with that comment. From start to finish we loved the stunning Beauty of this amazing country. 

Here is some information on our tour - 
We chose Umi Travel and tours. This tour was booked through our wonderful hotel in El Nido, The Sea Cocoon Hotel. Which is definitely the best place to stay in El Nido. Our Tour left El Nido beach around 8.30am and we arrived back about 4pm.

The Tour Included stops at 
- Seven Commando Beach
- Secret Lagoon
- Snorkelling And Lunch 
- Kayak at Big Lagoon

We have been travelling the Philippines for the last few weeks. Our first day in Philippines was in the capital city of Manila. Our first video We explore  Manila is available to watch here https://youtu.be/cFWKWEGIiOc

After Manila we took a flight from manila to puerto princesa. We then had to travel from puerto princesa to el nido (which was rough if we are being honest) In our last video we gave our first impressions of el nido. Spoiler alert, we loved it. Palawan is why you travel to the Philippines. Whenever you check out Philippines travel tips and recommendations, El Nido always comes up. It really has some of the Best beaches in the Philippines. We also love Experiencing Filipino hospitality and to be honest we found much more of it here in Palawan than in Manila. We would highly recommend renting a scooter in Palawan, you can get Off-the-beaten-path in the Philippines with your own set of wheels. We have one more video to come from Palawan. It is definitely a Must-visit destinations in the Philippines. without a doubt. Its is probably the Top attractions in the Philippines but we have many other places to explore so maybe that could change. We cant wait to Explore the Philippines so please make sure to subscribe to our channel and join us on this trip.

Many individuals contemplating a journey to the Philippines often wonder about the experience of waking up in a floating, off-grid DREAM HOUSE situated above the water in a private lagoon off Coron Island. The reality is Paolyn Houseboats is nothing short of incredible.

These unique houseboats serve as both accommodations and a restaurant, making them the sole options on Coron Island. Notably, the island holds the distinction of being a National Reserve, Marine Reserve, Unesco Biosphere Reserve, and the Ancestral Land of the Tagbanua Tribe.

Paolyn Houseboats is responsible for employing over 124 individuals, with a significant number hailing from the Tagbanua Tribe.

A genuine Philippine adventure would be incomplete without a visit to Coron Island. This uninhabited gem is renowned for eco-tourism, world-class diving, and the exploration of WW2 shipwrecks. It's also a cherished destination among Filipinos themselves, attesting to its exceptional appeal.

Why not try the most amazing floating airbnb in all of Asia now? It is the perfect place to relax on your adventure from El Nido to Coron!

During our stay, we participated in a full-day guided tour led by two members of the island's ancestral tribe, the Tagbanua. If you're planning your visit, this episode is tailor-made for you. Let's delve into the details.

Book tour A here: https://www.klook.com/activity/4168-el-nido-island-hopping-tour-a-palawan/?af_wid=7934&currency=USD&aid=cb0877eb0c6712d5

I went on private island hopping tours to find out which one between the popular Tour A and the less crowded Tour B is better, to help you make a deicision, especially if you are short on time!

Tour A included 5 stops: The big and small lagoons, the hidden lagoon, snorkeling spot, Seven Commandos Beach, and Shimizu Island. I loved the big lagoon, and would highly suggest that instead of renting a kayak, you opt to swim through it. It was the best way to experience the big lagoon, in my opinion! Because it was a private tour, I was able to customize my routes and avoid the crowds. We had the hidden lagoon, Seven Commandos Beach and Shimizu Island all to ourselves for a good few minutes, which would not have been possible on a group tour. 

I paid 6000 pesos for a private Tour A. You can read more about it here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/el-nido-tour-a/

Tour B also included 5 stops: Entalula Beach,  Snake Island, Cudugnon Cave, Cathedral Cave, and Pinagbuyutan Island. Note that because it was a private tour, I was able to reverse the route, which ended up being a great decision as we had all spots all to ourselves / shared with just a few other people! The tour is also less popular compared to Tour A, but enjoyable nonetheless. 

I paid 5000 pesos for a private Tour B. You can read more about it here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/el-nido-tour-b/

So which tour is better? Watch until the end of the video to find out!

I went on a private island hopping tour around Romblon Island and had such an amazing time! Besides the famous Bon Bon Beach, my guide took me to 4 other cool spots:

1. Bon Bon Beach: Bon Bon Beach sandbar is Romblon Island’s most famous feature. There were hundreds of people on it during low tide, so we left and came back during high tide. I recommend doing the same as the experience without too many people around was just so much better!

2. Tiamban Beach: This beautiful beach was decorated with palm trees, white sands and crystal clear water! It's great for relaxing and soaking in the calm water.

3. Logbon Beach: The Logbon Pool forms during certain time of the year, which I was not able to see in April, but it was great for snorkeling. Like Tiamban Beach, the water was calm and crystal clear.

4. Marakay Marakay Island Diving Board: If cliff jumping is your thing, be sure to make a stop at the Marakay Marakay Island Diving Board! You will see many local kids climbing and jumping off the cliff, so join the party!

5. Tinagong Dagat: Apart from Bon Bon, Tinagong Dagat was one of the things I wanted to see most during my Romblon Island hopping trip. I loved soaking in the water surrounded by cool rock formations! You will need flip flops or water shoes for this one, as the rocks are sharp.

For more information on how to get to Romblon Island, where to stay and other activities on the island, check out my full guide to Romblon Island here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/romblon-island-hopping/

Anuntam inca de la inceput ca locurile pe care le-am vazut in vlogul asta chiar se pot incadra ca fiind cele mai frumoase din Coron.
 Putem spune ca stim deja ce inseamna sa vizitezi un loc impreuna cu alti 1000 de turisti in acelasi timp, dar merita. Evident ca intr-un tur privat poti opri unde vrei tu si te poti bucura de momentele tale de liniste, dar cele mai frumoase locuri sunt incadrate intr-un tur.
 Ne-am hotarat sa vizitam Bulogdos, Banana si Malcapuya island in primul rand pornind de la numarul de opriri dar little did we knew ca sunt la cel putin doua ore distanta de Coron.
Prima oprire Bulogdos Island ne-a impresionat prin fasia de nisip cu valuri din stanga si dreapta care trasau locul cel mai bun de pozat pe care toata lumea ""se batea"" sa prinda poza aia buna de instagram. Am rugat un tip sa ne faca si noua o poza si cum stateam noi, il auzim: hai toata lumea ""Smeeeeelllll"" nu ""smile"" ci ""smell"" creionand astfel un nou tic verbal pentru noi de fiecare data cand vom mai face vreo poza :)
Banana Island, una din multele plaje/insule cu acelasi nume dar asta chiar daca se numeste asa, e doar din cauza ca are forma unei banane si nu pentru ca exista banani pe plaja. Aici am gasit cea mai frumoasa apa din Suceava, Da! ... pardon Coron, Da! o oaza de fericire cu tot ce iti doresti sa gasesti intr-o vacanta.
Malcapuya Island, perla acestui tur, ne-a prins usor obositi dar fiecare centimetru de plaja si verdeata de aici  ne-au bucurat enorm si am salvat cateva ""vederi"" in suflet si pe care le mai puteti vedea la noi pe instagram.com/travel_n2 :) .
Daca ajungi in Coron, aceste trei insule nu trebuie sa le ratati!

We visited the hidden beach of Bantayan Island, the Paradise Beach.  It is truly hidden.  A small raw walk way between wild trees was built for people to reach this hidden gem.  It will take a approximate 20 minutes walk depending on how fast or slow you are in a rough path to reach the beach from the main street.  This beach is one of the best beach we've been to in the Philippines.  We recommend visiting it when in Bantayan Island.

Here is a cinematic drone shot we did at the White Island in Camiguin, Philippines.  This island is very beautiful and riding the boat  to reach there is nicely organized.  Not to mention, it is not loaded with a lot of tourists. We did enjoy our visit in this island and we highly recommend it!!!

PUTING ISLA SA CAMIGUIN | PILIPINAS

Narito ang isang cinematic drone shot na ginawa namin sa Puting  Isla ng Camiguin, Pilipinas. Ang isla na ito ay napakaganda at ang pagsakay sa bangka upang makarating doon ay mahusay at maayos. Ang isla ay hindi ito puno ng maraming turista. Nasiyahan kami sa aming pagbisita sa islang ito at lubos naming inirerekumenda ito !!!

Take a walking tour through White Beach in Boracay Island. 
Boracay was awarded as the 2012 best island in the world from the international travel magazine Travel + Leisure. In 2014, the resort island was at the top of the Best Islands in the World list published by the international magazine Condé Nast Traveler. In 2016, Boracay headed the magazine's list of Top 10 destinations to watch. 

In April 2018 the Philippine Government decreed a 6-month closure of the island for tourists to undertake major renovation works, especially of the sewerage system, which had become obsolete and insufficient. It re-opened in October 2018 with a set of new rules meant to address a variety of issues. 

This 15 mins video was shot in 4K. The video will be uploaded twice or three times a week. Please let me know the location and street of Korea you want to see. I hope you can enjoy the walk!

Le TOUR B incroyablement diversifié et magnifiquement beau, c' est le premier tour de bateau que nous avons fait à El Nido.

Le TOUR B est composé de 5 arrêts : 
- La Snake Island
- Pinagbuyutan Island
- Cudugnon Cave
- Cathedral Cave
- Entalula Beach
La Cathedral Cave étant fermée de temps en temps à cause de la dangerosité du lieu, vous pouvez également vous arrêter à un banc de sable juste en face.

Nous sommes passés par la compagnie de bateau BELLITTA TOURS : 
https://www.facebook.com/bellittatours/

Le TOUR B c'est super bien passé, nous avons pris un bateau privé pour 7,500 Pesos pour 2 personnes repas compris.
Départ à 8h du matin car la plupart des bateaux pleins de touristes commencent à 9h.
On a fait le tour dans le sens inverse des tours classiques pour éviter un maximum la foule sur la première partie de notre tour de bateau.
Ca a plutôt bien marché car nous étions souvent seuls à chaque fois que l'on s'arrêtait.
Il s'agit du seul tour de bateau ne comportant pas d'arrêt dédié au snoerkling, c'est pour ça qu'on en a fait à notre tout premier arrêt 😊 
L'autre avantage d'avoir un bateau privé est que vous pouvez choisir combien de temps vous souhaitez rester sur une ile, quand est-ce que vous partez du port le matin, bref, vous êtes assez libres ! 
Le repas sur le bateau était divin, et manger de super produits dans un cadre merveilleux comme la Snake Island ça n'a pas de prix. 

Nous avons fait les 4 tours de bateau proposés à El Nido, le TOUR A, TOUR B, TOUR C et TOUR D.

Les prochaines vidéos sur les tours de bateau à El Nido arrivent très prochainement 😉 

Nous te souhaitons un bon visionnage ❤

Les TOUR A, TOUR B, TOUR C et TOUR D sont les activités les plus connues de El Nido, Palawan. 
Le TOUR A vous fera découvrir de nombreuses plages et iles paradisiaques. C'est le dernier tour de bateau que nous avons fait à El Nido.

Le TOUR A est composé de 5 arrêts : 
- Big Lagoon
- Secret Lagoon
- Simizu Island
- 7th Commando beach
- Snoerkling

Les plages paradisiaques d'EL nido font souvent rêver et il y a de quoi. 
On vous explique comment éviter au mieux la foule pour avoir la meilleure expérience possible sur ces plages de sable blanc aux eaux turquoises !

Nous avons pris un tour Privé en bateau avec la compagnie ci dessous pour 7500php pour 2 repas compris. 
C'est une super agence avec qui on a pu profiter de nos tours comme il se doit.

Départ à 8h du matin car la plupart des bateaux pleins de touristes commencent à 9h.
Nous avos commencé par le Big Lagoon qui est l'un des lieux les plus prisés du TOUR A.
Le Secret lagoon est très rapidement noir de monde, par contre la plage juste à côté est incroyable.
Ce tour de bateau comporte un arrêt dédié au snoerkling.
L'autre avantage d'avoir un bateau privé est que vous pouvez choisir combien de temps vous souhaitez rester sur une ile, quand est-ce que vous partez du port le matin, bref, vous êtes assez libres !

We explore around Kayangan Lake, Barracuda Lake and Twin Lagoon then head out to do some swimming around the reefs, ship wreck and Coral Garden. There are many islands in and around Coron. While in Palawan I visited Puerto Princesa, El Nido and Coron.

We arrived from El Nido into Busuanga via prop plane. Island Hopping around the waters seems to be the most popular tourist activity. On several of these islands you will find untouched beautiful beaches. We show you most of the Coron tourist spots as we go around to many of the main attractions on the island of Coron. Enjoy this Coron travel vlog.

I have put together a list of the top places in the Philippines for you to visit and even research. Philippines tourism appears to be back to normal and these tourist spots are thriving again. I really enjoyed Palawan and many would say that is the best place in the Philippines, with El Nido and Coron being the top places there. I also felt Siargao was a special place to visit for its diversity in activities to do. Boracay seemed to be the most popular tourist destination in Philippines.

Get a taxi or maybe walk from your hotel if you happen to be within Davao city area.
Talicud and Kaputi-an can be access can be access from Santa Ana warf via Ferry boat.

Commercial or passengers boat goes to Kapu-tian and Talicud every 20 to 30 minutes waiting time.

It is important that you bring your own food and drinks as the island has limited supply of food and water.

Kaputi-an and Talicud Island has very clear water when I was there. I saw fish swimming right next to me.

It feels so nature. Love my the locals.
I always say.. I go where the local goes.

Hello, we are a Korean couple living in Cebu, Philippines.
We live with Joan, a Filipino maid.
How much is the house in the village in the Philippines?
I was surprised at a lower price than I thought.

These magnificent islands where you will feel that time stands still
and you will often forget exactly where in the world you are

A little piece of paradise that looks like a remote heaven in Polynesia or Fiji
it’s still one of those off the beaten path destinations in the Philippines

Balabac Islands are considered the final frontier of the Philippines because of their location
They are located in the beautiful Sulu Sea in Southern Palawan
 and considered and integral part of it,
 but they are more close to Malaysia than any other place in the entire Philippines

After having experienced the 4Days and 3 Nights island hopping expedition between El Nido and Coron in our previous visit in the Philippines, which we absolutely loved, 
this time we really wanted to do the same in the more remote islands of Balabac.

So join us in the next few episodes of our Philippines series
 where we tell you and show you all you need to know about

*I use both of these companies depending on the destination and requirements of entry. If you are going to be abroad for a long time and/or don't need as much coverage, I would recommend SafetyWing. BUT you cannot purchase SafetyWing WHILE in Canada or USA. You can only purchase once already abroad. Hey Mondo is more expensive but offers a higher level of coverage including plans that have trip cancellation/interruption insurance. Hey Mondo would be the better insurance to use if you need travel medical insurance when applying for a visa. Both companies cover covid.

Yes, it is one of the most popular attractions in the area, but it is 100% worth the hype (at least in my opinion). It was recently named one of the 7 New Wonders of Nature and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tour companies all over Puerto Princesa offer this tour and depending on which company you go with it should cost approximately $40-50 USD per person for a full day trip including lunch.

We will check out Moalboal and the sardine run, we head up to Osmena Peak and the central mountains, as well as explaining why we WON'T be doing the whale shark experience in Oslob.

'Back on the Road'

Damn it feels so good to be back on the road

Been way too long since I've been back on the road
I've missed the wind in my hair
I've missed the roar of my engine

Don't know where I am going
But I don't care
I just wanna drive anywhere

The open road is my home
And there is nothing I'd trade it for

Back on the open road
My one true love

----------

Embark on an unforgettable journey to Baguio, Philippines, as we uncover the top things to do in this charming mountain city. Nestled in the scenic Cordillera Central Range, Baguio offers a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of city life, with its cool climate, breathtaking views, and vibrant culture.

Our adventure begins with a visit to the iconic Burnham Park, a picturesque urban park named after Daniel Burnham, the city's American architect. Take a leisurely boat ride on the serene man-made lake, stroll through lush gardens, and try your hand at various recreational activities like biking, roller skating, and picnicking.

Next, we explore the enchanting Mines View Park, where you can soak in panoramic views of the surrounding mountains and the old mining town. Don't miss the opportunity to have your photo taken wearing traditional Cordillera attire or to sample fresh strawberries and other local produce from the nearby stalls.

For a taste of Baguio's rich cultural heritage, we take you to the Tam-Awan Village. Immerse yourself in the traditional arts and crafts of the Cordillera people as you explore the village's recreated traditional huts and art galleries. Engage in workshops on weaving, wood carving, and other indigenous crafts, and appreciate the beauty of local artwork.

No trip to Baguio is complete without experiencing the vibrant Baguio Public Market. Wander through its bustling stalls and indulge in a gastronomic adventure, sampling local delicacies like strawberry taho, fresh vegetables, and Baguio's famous longganisa. Bargain for unique souvenirs, handicrafts, and colorful woven products.

Nature lovers will be delighted by the breathtaking beauty of the Botanical Garden. Take a leisurely walk amidst vibrant flower beds, explore native huts showcasing the indigenous culture of the Cordillera region, and encounter the famous Igorot sculpture garden.

Discover the fascinating history of Baguio at the Baguio Cathedral, also known as Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral. Marvel at its stunning architecture and enjoy a moment of serenity inside the church. Nearby, visit the Baguio Museum, which showcases the city's history, culture, and indigenous heritage.

We start off the day to a beautiful sunrise in Mactan, Cebu, Philippines. We then fly to Boracay with family and friends.  We booked our transportation to the island from the airport through Southwest. They took us on a bus, a boat and later a taxi to our hotel in Station 2. We then walked to Station 1 to meet my relative Louella at the Le Soleil de Boracay. She gave us some tips on the things to do as well as some local favorites. Check out the places of interest below for the full list of where we went.  Our absolute best highlight was viewing the fireworks at New Years on White Beach. I've never seen such an amazing array of fireworks shows mixed with those from the locals.  This was a great place to spend a few days before we headed back to Manila.

This is Episode 9 of my Philippines Adventure Series.  There's plenty of excitement ahead as we travel throughout this beautiful country and truly learn how to have more fun!

This video documentary brings you along for my visit before and after this super storm.  Click here to watch: https://youtu.be/IhnioRvjlAU

See us travel to Tacloban, Leyte, Philippines to visit family and see the recovery effort after the most destructive and deadliest Philippine typhoon ever.  I visited in January, 2013 before the storm.  Then I joined my brother Caleb and his girl friend Jessica to visit again in December, 2015.  My relative Rebecca reveals her family's incredible story of survival during the storm as the storm surge surprised everyone.  See the recovery, the support received and most importantly the resilience of these amazing people here!

Welcome and today, I am going to visit 3 of the best museums in manila, National Museum of Natural History, National Museum of Anthropology and National Museum of the Philippines.

▶️ Please Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/RobbieTravels 

There are a lot of museums to see in Manila, but there are a few that stand out and should be on everyone's list. There are three museums that you must visit.

The first thing we did this morning was go to the National Museum of Natural History. Rizal Park is home to one of the most popular museums in the country, which opened to the public in May 2018. Everyone, including Filipinos, foreigners, students, adults, and children, doesn't have to pay anything to get in.

The ""Tree of Life"" is the center of the atrium at the National Museum of Natural History. The museum has 6 floors. Tree of Life, Lolong, Rainforest Diorama, Mangrove Diorama, and The Marine Realm are the best places to visit. The displays are set up by ecosystem, with mountains and forests on the upper floors and wetlands and the underwater world on the lower floors. Start at the top and go down.

Then we ate lunch at Jollibee, the biggest fast food chain in the Philippines.

Then we started to look around the National Museum of Anthropology. The National Museum of Anthropology used to be called the Museum of the Filipino People. It shows us how people used to live in the past. Among them is the skullcap of Tabon Man, who lived in the Philippines around 24,000 BC and is thought by some to have been a woman.

The wreck of the San Diego, a Spanish galleon that sank off the coast of Luzon in 1600, takes up a lot of space in the museum. Items like shell-covered swords, coins, porcelain plates, and jewelry that were found on the ship are on display. There is also a large collection of pre-Columbian artifacts and musical instruments, as well as displays of native textiles.

We went to the National Museum of the Philippines at the end of the day. The National Museum of the Philippines is a large collection of museums and a planetarium that opened in 1901. It is right next to Rizal Park. Through the museum's large collections of fine art, ethnography, anthropology, archaeology, and natural history, you can learn about the history, art, and culture of the Philippines.

The National Museum includes the National Museum of Fine Arts, the National Museum of Anthropology, the National Museum of Natural History, and the National Planetarium. There are also branches of the museum all over the Philippines. It is also a place for education, culture, and science. It has lectures, interviews, publications, and different research programs.

The museum complex is so big that people should focus on the things that are most important to them.

These are just three of the many interesting museums in Manila. If you stay in Manila for an Uncharted Philippines adventure, you can see all of these and more.

So, watch the video till the end and let me know your thoughts in the comments.

Travelling to the Philippines? 🇵🇭 Check out our ULTIMATE Philippines Guide: https://couplesquest.gumroad.com/l/ultimate-philippines-ebook-guide 

Everything about the Palawan island hopping expedition was perfect 👌🏼. We slept on remote islands, found hidden beaches, snorkelled amazing reefs, ate delicious Filipino food, met great people, and had the best time 🙌🏼. If you’re trying to plan how to get from Coron to El Nido, or getting from El Nido to Coron then do not miss out on one of the best tours in the Philippines 🇵🇭. 

Who did we book our tour with?
Buhay Isla are the ones responsible for putting in such an incredible tour. They didn't sponsor this video, we genuinely just had the best time and would recommend them -https://www.buhayisla.com/  

Now that we have arrived in El Nido, Palawan, we will be exploring more of the incredible beaches, islands and lagoons in this dreamy paradise. We can't wait to share more of our time in this amazing country with you. Keep an eye out for our next Philippines travel vlog 🙌🏼.

Yvonne, Panos and Jed go surfing, hiking, swimming with turtles, experience a sound healing and even join a wedding at the beach.

In the Philippines host Chris convinces the travelers to eat all sorts of Filipino food including Balut - a fertilized duck egg. Do you think the travelers liked it?

What is Yuujou?

Six genuine people from different cultural backgrounds set out on a unique adventure to show the power of friendship around the world. The international media art project Yuujou is an excellent example for humanity and the wonders that can be achieved if we only open ourselves to connecting with others.

Yuujou is a 100-day travel adventure from Berlin to Tokyo! Through an extraordinary travel experiment Yuujou wants to show the importance of friendship. In April 2019, two teams of three people each start their journey in Berlin. One team goes east, the other one west. Within 100 days, both teams try to make it to the other side of the world – Japan. The journey is a real adventure! The route unfolds along the way, because the travelers only travel from one friend to another: The next stop must be a friend of the previous friend. If the teams meet again in Japan, a chain of friendship around the world is created.

To help the local population adapt, Louise founded The Cacao Project, which provides farmers with climate-resilient cacao seedlings, and teaches them how to sustainably produce and market this unique crop. 

To date, Louise has helped over 200 farmers to plant some 85,000 trees – cultivating her community's resilience.

3 days in El Nido, Palawan. A good memory of beautiful islands, transparent marble ocean and nice people. This island is still somewhat hidden to tourists and some can find off-the-path travel here.

Some short info about this island:
El Nido is a coastal settlement and major tourist destination on the Philippines island of Palawan. El Nido comprises 45 islands and islets; limestone cliffs are also found here, which form a Karst backdrop similar to those found in Ha Long Bay, Krabi and Guilin. El Nido is a popular destination for locals during the long holidays of Holy Week but, until recently, has been relatively unknown to foreign tourists. Beaches, clear waters (away from the main town), jungle, steep limestone cliffs and stunning inlets make for beautiful seascapes.

We also visited Tumalog Falls, which was unique from the other waterfalls we have seen!

As much as we had a lot fun, we felt guilty for the whale sharks. There were some controversies surrounding this tour. We do see both disadvantages and advantages of it. It is good for tourism and the province of Cebu, but how about the sustainability of this practice and the whale shark's conservation?

This trip is a little escape from our über busy life! So much has been happening lately and Slater and I are so thankful we got to rest and relax in this amazingly serene villa. From the first day till the last, all our pent-up stress disappeared with every relaxing activity. We've explored a lot of what the place has to offer and was quite impressed at how they truly provide you with a holistic relaxation.

Hi guys! Sharing with you our great experience in Crimson Resort & Spa Boracay with a little room and resort tour. We highly recommend this place!

Crimson Resort and Spa Boracay | Where to Stay in Boracay Philippines by Finding Paradise
https://youtu.be/3YGUD5SaMYg
Crimson Resort in Boracay is a luxury 5 star resort in the Philippines. In fact is is one of the best resorts in Boracay. Located on a beautiful private beach (station zero), the Crimson Boracay offers its guests unprecedented service and accommodation. The resort looks stylish and modern. I compare the Crimson Resort to the Shangri-la Resort as well so you can see which is the better resort to stay in Boracay.

ms0mFEOfiu8,2020-01-08T10:16:33Z,UCvezSDMyptnJPLzAVzoTg2w,PUERTO PRINCESA UNDERGROUND RIVER TOUR 🇵🇭 PHILIPPINES PART 1,"Puerto Princesa, Philippines📍

Part one of our time in the Philippines began in Puerto Princesa on the island of Palawan.  The city has a laid-back, old-school vibe with lots and lots and lots of fast-food joints (Jollibee anyone?). It was a mixed experience with very long power-cuts and blinding heat but once we got out of the city it was easy to see Palawan’s beautiful natural wonders.

WHAT WE GOT UP TO: 

We would advise if you are visiting Palawan to see El Nido or Coron to consider skipping Puerto Princesa and traveling straight up to El Nido via bus. The town doesn’t have loads to offer but it was a nice relaxing stopover for a couple of days for us. The town has one main strip, Rizal Avenue, which most shops and fast-food restaurants are based. We spent most of our time walking around the town, visiting the Immaculate Conception Cathedral and the Baywalk Park.  Make sure you get in one of the unusual trikes for a tour of the city in style.

Must visit: Eightynine café - this little joint on the East side of Rizal Avenue just past the airport has great coffee, a modern feel and inventive breakfast options. The service was great due to five members of staff for only two covers (often very common in Asia). They even put cute cartoon stencils on your coffee! 

Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park - We booked a tour through Klook at £25 each.  This included transit to the national park, a great buffet lunch and a tour guide for the day. There is a maximum number of people allowed in the caves every day and so you may need to wait around for a slot. As part of the tour we were able to either purchase an extra of ziplining or a mangrove tour - we chose ziplining - it was a fun way to pass the time whilst waiting for our slot.The expanse of the caves were huge. In order to preserve the caves and not disturb bats 🦇, there isn’t a lot of light inside. It was still a great experience and we were given the front of the canoe for the best view.

ABOUT US: We’re a couple based in Leeds, UK. Like everyone, we love a good holiday but we're making our love of travel the main part of the next year by backpacking and traveling to new places. At the end of 2018 we decided to undertake a big travel adventure whilst we’re young and with no commitments. At the moment we've planned to be away for one year but it could be longer! We moved out of our flat and in with parents to save money and have left our jobs ready to start our once in a lifetime tour ✈️. We hope to vlog about our experiences and share with you our journey whilst backpacking. We’ve got some idea of the areas we want to visit but this may expand whilst we’re away 🗺️

dbdGpkHLx9Y,2020-07-05T15:00:09Z,UCGWoqB49Ux1G0Sbhl3CrN9A,[4K] Travel to Philippines and Explore Coron with Paolo as Your Tour Guide 🇵🇭,"🎥 Kayangan lake is by far the most popular spot on Coron island and is 70% freshwater and 30% saltwater, said Paolo. It's a crystal-clear freshwater lake with unbelievable underwater rock formations. 

Twin lagoons are one of the must-see destinations in the island-hopping tour. The first lagoon is where the boats dock while the second lagoon is hidden. 

Barracuda lake was named such due to the discovery of a large Barracuda fish skeleton in the depths of its waters. It is one of the famous free diving sites not only in Coron but also in the entire country. Barracuda lake is composed of both salt and freshwater but the most notable feature of this lake, especially for divers, is its layers of cold-warm, and hot water is also known as the thermocline. 

Black island is known to locals as Malajon island and it is a huge mysterious-looking island near Busuanga. From a distance, it has an eerie feeling despite beautiful white beaches and components once you step forth into the shore very many.
