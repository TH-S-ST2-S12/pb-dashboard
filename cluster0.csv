About This Episode:
TOday we're in Cebu City looking for that classic Filipino tasty treat, Dinuguan which is basically a stew of internal pig organs and the most special ingredient, pig blood. Along the way, we also side quest at the market and try some of the Philippines classic Bagoong, which is a pink fermented shrimp paste. It does not get more intense or yummy than today's video.

Well, they boodle, of course! In the Philippines, friends and family gather for a boodle fight, a fabulous feast served atop banana leaves and eaten with bare hands. Traditionally created as a way to feed large numbers of military cadets, people stand shoulder-to-shoulder around a massive table, ready to dive into piles of mouthwatering Filipino delicacies, like grilled pork, adobo and crispy pata. Just be sure to leave your forks and knives at home.

INSANE Seafood Meal at Dampa Market Manila Philippines,"When I was in Manila Philippines I was told that I HAD to get some FRESH seafood at a local seafood market called Dampa. At this market, you shop for seafood items like fresh fish, crabs, clams, mussels, lobsters and then take the seafood to a number of local restaurants located nearby so they can prepare it for you in a variety of ways.

We also happened to run into a few very friendly friends from Saudia Arabia and went with them to their hotel for a Salmon and Rice feast. After which we returned to the seafood market, selected some fish, crab, clams, and prawns. We then headed for a restaurant called Hong Kong Master Cook and begin one of the most delicious seafood feasts I've ever had!

The seafood was prepared in many different ways and my favorite was the fish cooked in spicy chili broth. Also, the crab was some of the most tender onesI've ever had. I would highly recommend this seafood market if ever in Manila Philipines.

w46Fslwmujo,2018-03-15T17:53:09Z,UCXOKEdfOFxsHO_-Su3K8SHg,NIGHT MARKET FOOD in Manila Philippines: BBQ & BLOOD STEW,"My last night in Manila Philippines and I really wanted to try out one of the local popular night market for some night time eats. One of my local friends suggested Central Mercado a wonderfully vibrant night market in the heart of Manila.

The night market first of all, smelled incredible. From the roasted meat skewers to the refreshing local drinks, there was something for everyone at this night market.

Having filled up on great eats at this night market, I proceeded to a local restaurant that many locals recommended for a taste of Dinuguan which is essentially pork blood stew with organ meat inside.

We're on the search for hanging coffins in Sagada. As a foreigner in the Philippines, I was told I should go to echo valley to see the famous hanging coffins of the Igorot people. This area gets hundreds of Filipino tourists from Manila, Baguio City, and across the country every day. On Fearless & Far, we're always on the search for the next level. The deeper experience. The adventure that challenges us.
I met up with my guide Chris and Angdung and we grabbed our machetes and hiking boots, and dove into the jungle. Looking for other sites that others have not visited in a long long time. We found exactly that.

The unique death rituals of the mountain people of Cordillera are not for the squeamish.In all my philippines travel vlog experiences, this was perhaps the most shocking and interesting topic I have come across.  

While there are hanging coffins in China, and also similar practices in Indonesia, there's nothing quite like what happens here in Sagada, Mountain Province.

They had never had it before and they really loved it! Super cool to see Americans trying halo-halo for the first time, and to spread a bit of Pinoy culture in NYC!

We got it from a small Filipino cafe in NYC called Kabisera that makes the dessert from scratch, including by using their own Filipino ice cream, so it was super authentic and delicious. Made with red bean, jackfruit, ube, Filipino ice cream, shaved ice, condensed milk, coconut, and leche flan. They did not sponsor this video, but they are super nice, and if you want can check them out at: https://www.yelp.com/biz/kabisera-new-york-2

We try some delicious pork adobo, banana lumpia, and more! This famous market is located in Hyehwa Dong (혜화동). Enjoy this video of a foreigner trying Filipino food for the first time!

Share this video: https://youtu.be/BXSZVp68G_M

오늘 저희는 서울안의 작은 마닐라 필리핀 마켓 (리틀 마닐라)을 방문했습니다! 혜화동에 위치한 이곳에서 여러가지 음식과 볼거리등을 확인해보세요.
이 영상의 공유를 원하시면 여기 : https://youtu.be/BXSZVp68G_M

매주 일요일 오후, 혜화 역 근처의 작은 거리가 필리핀 음식 시장으로 바뀝니다. 수많은 필리핀 인들이 방문해서 럼 피아, 아도 보 (adobo), 빵싯(pancit) 등 신선한 필리핀 음식을 먹습니다. 

저희는 이 시장에서 판매되는 다섯 가지 필리핀 음식을 먹어 보았습니다. 이곳은 한국에서유일한 필리핀 거리 시장이며 저렴한 현지 물건들도 구매할수 있어서 한번쯤은 가보시길 추천합니다.

필리핀 출신의 많은 해외 ​​노동자들이 서울에서 고국음식이 먹고 싶을때 찾는 곳입니다.

시장은 매주 일요일 오후 헤화동에서 열립니다. 필리핀 현지음식과 여러가지 현지 용품.간식 스낵등 을 판매합니다. 이번주  # 혜화동 필리핀 마켓 한번 방문해보시는거 어떨까요?

Every Sunday afternoon, a small stretch of street near Hyehwa Station turns into a Filipino food market. Thousands of Filipinos come to this neighborhood to eat freshly prepared Filipino street foods including lumpia, adobo, and pancit. In Korean, this is often called 혜화동 필리핀 마켓. 

In this video, I sample five different Filipino street foods that are being sold at this market nicknamed 'Little Manila'. This is the only Filipino street market in Korea, and something you don't want to miss if you're visiting Seoul!

Many overseas workers from the Philippines search for the very best Filipino restaurant in Seoul. Personally, I believe the food at this market is the place to find the best Filipino food in all of Korea! 

The market is open every Sunday afternoon in #seoul. Customers can purchase freshly prepared meals, as well as other Filipino items such as toiletries and calling cards. Brave customers can even try balut eggs! Go to #혜화동필리핀마켓 today!

NEXT VLOG (cooking for my parents in law):
 
Asukal is one of them but I will look for potatoes, carrots, some meat, sauce and many more! I wonder how much USD people would pay on average for their groceries per week in the USA compared to the Philippines. California seems kind of expensive nowadays and I found the dollar is approximately the same value as the EUR so in this video I will mention the pricing of the groceries in Philippine pesos and US dollars for comparison.

I think compared to USA and Europe the Philippines still has a reasonable cost of living in 2022 although some items can be quite expensive as I will show in todays vlog on Youtube.

As a foreigner cooking Filipino food is one of my favorite things to do! I need to improve my Tagalog way more but I want to thank you for helping me out. This time I cooked chicken adobo in the garden and I used onions or sibuyas and garlic also called bawang in tagalog together with white vinegar and soy sauce, black pepper and sugar to create a tasty chicken dish to eat with rice!

Lately many foreigners cook filipino food and I think it is great because the dishes from The Philippines are so masarap! 

I am a Dutch guy so I cook the Filipino style chicken adobo outdoors in The Netherlands.

A foreigner cooking adobo might sound strange or funny but believe me the chicken tasted amazing 😜

Daing na bangus is a simple marinated milk fish using just fresh garlic, white vinegar, salt and black pepper and leave it overnight for full flavour. Bangus is very popular all over the Philippines but perhaps most popular in Dagupan City, Pangasinan where they even hold a bangus festival regularly.



In this recipe I will also include a simple sawsawan also known as dipping sauce and it is made from some spicy labuyo peppers, white vinegar, black pepper and chopped onions.


This food is best eaten in Kamayan style which is by using your hands!

MY FIRST EVER LECHON BELLY: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0N3LuTWXMw&list=PLLihyfqrQKhoHBk6J4APO6JvLjoDPZFGO&index=3

FULL RECIPE:
Take the lechon belly out of the freezer and let it defrost in the fridge overnight, take a paper towel and remove excess moist, add black pepper, salt, chili flakes and garlic powder inside as well as chives and crushed lemon grass. Roll the lechon belly and tie up with kitchen twine. Steam in steamer for about 30 min, then let cool off, wrap in plastic and put in the freezer for 2hrs.

Afterwards pre-heat the oven at 250C and rub the pork belly with salt, bake for 1,5hr then let cool off for 15-30 min and finally about 15min under the grill, watch continously since some pieces could burn quickly. Very crackling and crunchy for sure and a must try!!

Today, I'm back to check out some mobile stores and pop up shops here that were started by a group of classic motorcycle riders in Cebu Philippines.

They have various types of food like tacos, sandwiches, braised quail eggs, lumpia, and for vegetarians, fried noodles.

A van also sells handmade accessories, stickers, and sun-dried fish (bulad) from Bantayan Island.

The community is more like a close-knit family with similar interests and, in this case, classic motorcycles and food.

It's a totally unique experience as you see awesome classic motorcycles while your food is being cooked on the motorcycle itself.

If you're ever in Cebu Philippines, make sure to visit these mobile stores and pop up shops and restaurants. You can find their daily location through the links below:

Learn how to cook Filipino food by taking on the 4-week Filipino food cooking challenge here: http://bit.ly/2VqZBcj

SUBSCRIBE! In this video, I break down how to make the best chicken adobo recipe with a ""secret"" additional ingredient! The way I make chicken adobo is simple, but contain a few tips will guarantee chicken adobo that's packed with flavor, and also juicy and tender!

GRAB A KITCHEN THERMOMETER NOW: 

Remember, Filipino chicken adobo is always best served at least a day after cooking! Whenever I want adobo, I try to make sure I plan at least a day ahead of time. It makes a HUGE difference in taste, because the adobo sauce has time to marinade the chicken.

Watch the video to learn how your Filipino chicken adobo recipe changes flavor, depending on the small ingredient choices you make.

In this video, I prepare a boodle fight, aka a kamayan feast, aka ""pile a bunch of filipino food on top of banana leaves and eat with your hands"" feast! Half of the food I prepared from scratch, and the other half I purchased pre-marinated or fully cooked.

Make sure you properly plan out your menu and your schedule so you don't get overwhelmed. With only one person cooking and a few hours to do it, I had to make sure I was organized.

We had 10 people total (7 adults, 3 children), and had plenty of leftovers afterwards!

2l94S4_jMTY,2022-03-30T13:48:52Z,UCzjxQJtI4GqGaBwFagqv1AQ,Eating STREET FOOD in WORLDS OLDEST CHINATOWN 🇵🇭  Binondo Manila Philippines,"What an awesome day in Manila! We spent the day in the worlds OLDEST chinatown! Dating back to 1594! Even though you may think its old, the food, flavour and culture is still very much ALIVE here in the Philippines, and it certainly did not disappoint! 

In this video we venture around Chinatown also known as Binondo and get totally stuck into a wide variety of food and flavour! Our very first street food tour in the Philippines!

First up is Dong Bei Dumplings - excellent pork and chive dumplings 200 Pesos for 14! What a deal!
Next up we try Calamansi juice for the first time! 80 Pesos 
Lumpia (Giant vegetable burrito/spring roll - very delicious - 95 Pesos 
Shanghai Fried Siopao - this was the HIGHLIGHT of the food journey we had today! The most delicious steamed bun for only 30 Pesos, we can see why this was so popular!

Jollibee's are EVERYWHERE in the Philippines and this vlog is us TRYING JOLLIBEE FOR THE FIRST TIME 🇵🇭.  From their beloved FRIED CHICKEN, SPAGHETTI, TUNA PIE, & MORE we try it all!  Basically, this is a JOLLIBEE MUKBANG and if Jollibee sold it we ordered it!!!

We weren't sure what to order so we had the lovely people at a Jollibee here in CEBU CITY, PHILIPPINES order their most popular items.  So thank you ❤️

So go put on your bibs on (we most certainly should have) and grab a drink to quench your thirst from all this food and enjoy!!!

And if you haven't seen our latest video TRYING FILIPINO STREETS FOODS + BALUT make sure to head over here and watch it 😱. Honestly, we much prefer Jollibee to the Balut any day!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEIgBk9fJCM&t=768s

After that make sure to watch our latest latest video where we take you all Canyoneering and hear from someone of their first hand experience living through the destructive Typoon Odette here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oOhR2oh7E

We are generally creatures of habit, so we have a few foods we always find ourselves eating, enjoying, and eating again the next day HOWEVER since being in the Philippines that is no longer our reality.  Having friends here and eating home cooked meals and just trying anything and everything just for the experience has helped widen our likes and taste buds.

In this vlog we take you with us to explore that even more!!  With a very prominent and bustling Muslim population the food options are even more amazing in this beautiful city 😍. Heck, we discovered some of our favorite dishes are actually Muslim and can't wait to eat them again 😍

We've heard from so many of you that the food here is a must try and honestly you guys...you were NOT LYING 😱

The most famous of them all is probably the chicken inasal.  For those of you not familiar with chicken inasal, chicekn inasal is a variant of Filipino chicken dish called lechon manok.  It's marinated in a mixture of ingredients including calamansi, coconut vinegar, annatto, and more and then grilled over hot coals while based in the marinate. It's a barbeque style that honestly you guys, you MUST TRY if you haven't already.

In this vlog we take you to one of the most well known places for chicken inasal: Neena Beths, but we've also visited Chicken House and Coyoca here in Bacolod (not in the video) and we must confess they just as incredible!  And don't worry we made our way to Sharyn's too also try cansi, a special semi-sour beef soup which originated in Bacolod ❤️

We suggest anyone and everyone that makes their way to Bacolod City to try all the foods 😍. They clearly have their own signature styles and rank most certainly in the top 2 of the best we've yet to have in the 7 months of our time in the Philippines 😱

I tried a lot of Filipino food already in the past weeks, but never Filipino breakfast. Let's see what I can find here in Davao, the biggest city on the Mindanao island here in southern Philippines.

My goal is to give tips and advice on life in the Philippines.

I have had the opportunity to live here in the Philippines and have visiting multiple places here in the Philippines and have the pleasure of enjoying the country, its people and the culture of the Filipinos. 

I hope to share my experience as a foreigner living here in the Philippines and to give back to foreigners visiting or expats planning to move here in the Philippines. I plan to post videos weekly that vary in content that will help foreigners and expats.

Is Philippines good for expats? 
The Philippines is a top-rated destination for expatriates. The country has a warm climate, friendly people, welcoming culture, and low living costs make the country an ideal destination for expats. 

Where do most expats live in Philippines? 
Most expats in the Philippines live in the Metro Manila area, particularly in Makati City – home to many international corporations and the heart of the country's diplomatic community. 

Can a US citizen live permanently in the Philippines? 
Yes, under the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, Section 13 (a) you are eligible for permanent residency in the Philippines. Is retiring in the Philippines a good idea? Retiring in the Philippines can be a great escape when done right. Overall, you're going to notice goods and services are cheaper than they are in the U.S. You can also find affordable healthcare as long as you retire in a location close to hospitals. However, certain parts lack infrastructure and investment.

Philippines Tourism Tourism is an important sector for Philippine economy. 

In 2019, the travel and tourism industry contributed 12.7% to the country's GDP.[1] Philippines is an archipelagic country composed of 7,641 islands with 81 provinces divided in 17 regions. The country is known for having its rich biodiversity as its main tourist attraction. Its beaches, heritage towns and monuments, mountains, rainforests, islands and diving spots are among the country's most popular tourist destinations. 

The country's rich historical and cultural heritage, including its festivals and indigenous traditions, are also one of the attractions of Philippines. Popular destinations among tourists are Cebu, Boracay, Palawan, Siargao, and many more.

Back to another episode here in the Philippines, we are trying another popular fast food chain called Mang Inasal, which is well known for their grilled chicken. Going into the restaurant we had no expectations, but our minds were blown as soon as we went in. Firstly, the staff at the restaurant greeted us with enthusiasm. Secondly, we walked in and immediately saw chefs preparing the mouth watering chicken behind the glass window. We ordered the Pecho Chicken Set which comes with a big chicken, rice, soft drinks and we also ordered the empanada. It costed 252 pesos in total which is 6.6AUD/ 4.4USD. 

The chicken came faster than expected and the smell was on the next level. As soon as I took my first bite, all the memories from childhood came back from 10 years ago when I first visited Cebu and had roast chicken on the streets. It had the exact same taste. I rated this fast food chain the best in the Philippines as it is definitely my personal favourite.

If you are wondering what is the best things to do in the Philippines 2022, you have come to the right channel. Coming to the Philippines, we had two goals. One is to understand and learn about the culture of the Philippines. Second, is to try the all the filipino food.

In this episode, we arrived at Chowking, a popular filipino fast food chain  that is well known for its Chinse Filipino cuisine and it is a favourite amongst Filipino. We arrived at Ayala Cebu City Chowking, upon arrival, my first impression was that Chowking reminds me of home

Alina and I ordered the wonton soup, 2x chicken siomai, pork siomai with chowfan set. I believe Alina found her happy place in this episode because she loved the chicken siomai, wonton soup and surprisingly she is in love with the spicy sauce. However for me, perhaps because I grew up in Hong Kong where Dimsim and chinese food is everywhere, I didn't find it particularly special. If only they had Halo Halo....Nevertheless, it was a great and affordable meal!

As many of our subscribers might know, Alina and I are huge foodies and are always open to trying new food. 4 months into living in the Philippines we have made numerous Filipino food reaction videos from the best soup in the world - Filipino Sinigang to the unique peanut dish Kare Kare to some of our favourite Filipino Inasals at fast food or roadside vendors, but one particular Filipino style restaurant we haven't tried was the famous budget canteens carinderias, where home-style Filipino cooking are displayed in trays and the locals can point and choose what they want.

In this episode, I met up with one of my subscribers Gelo and went on a food adventure to a local carinderia called Aling Sosing situated in Makakati where I gave my first impression of carinderia in the Philippines. Growing up in Hong Kong and Australia, my family is not very used to tasting the internal organs of animals, such as chicken hearts, pork liver and intestines etc so I was very sceptical about trying them when we first arrived. However part of the reason why I decided to travel full-time is that I want to embrace different cultural experiences. We tried a variety of dishes and overall had a great experience eating on the roadside.

Welcome to a new episode here in the beautiful city of Manila the Philippines. Throwback to 4 months ago when we first came to the Philippines, the first Filipino dish that we were introduced to is the ""best soup in the world"", sour soup Sinigang. Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savoury taste. It is most often associated with tamarind, although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent. It is one of the more popular dishes in Filipino cuisine. The soup is usually accompanied by rice. After settling into our apartment, we finally are ready to take on a Sinigang cooking challenge. 

We invited our friend Joy who can also speak fluent Russian, she is able to communicate fluently in Russian with Alina which is a bonus, to teach us how to cook traditional Filipino Sinigang. We first met up at BGC Landmark to grab all the ingredients necessary for making the soup then we started cooking Sinigang for 1.5 hours.

Join us as we teach you how to make Sinigang!

If you are wondering what is the best things to do in the Philippines 2022, you have come to the right channel. Coming to the Philippines, we had two goals. One is to understand and learn about the culture of the Philippines. Second, is to try the most popular filipino fast food chain - Jollibee. Just kidding, but trying Jollibee is definitely high up on our bucket list. 

Finally today is the day. We arrived in the hustling and bustling district of Divisoria and tried Jollibee. Upon arrival, my first impression was that Jollibee felt a bit like KFC with all the fried chicken options. However as I looked at the menu closely, Jollibee offers a wider variety of options such as spaghetti, mushroom sauce on meat patty with rice and even special pies. 

Alina and I ordered the set which comes with the signature Jollibee spaghetti, meat patty with mushroom sauce, fried chicken and we also ordered 2 ice cream, cheesy hot dog and mango pie on top of that. Everything was amazing and as I mentioned in the video it was one of my favourite fast food experience. No wonder so many Filipinos highly recommend Jollibee.

Kumusta friends from the Philippines,

Continuing on our adventure in Divisoria, we are finally trying some street food. For those of you who have been following my backpacking journey since the start of you would know that I am a big fan of street food and will try any if I have the chance (of course with caution).

Today I had the opportunity to try Ice Cream on the street run by a man called Ramin (hope I spelt his name correctly). There were two flavours, cookie and cream or cheese flavour. Without a doubt, I picked cookie and cream because it is my favourite flavour. It costed 30 pesos for a big cone and it was delicious.

Here in Little Manila,  located in Woodside, Queens - This is the best place in New York City to explore variety of filipino restaurants which the one we visited and show you in this video literally gave the exact authentic taste just like the cuisine we tried in the philippines.

We went to Kabayan in little Manila and we are not disappointed by the taste. The food we ordered are Bulalo, which is the restaurant's specialty. We also tried sisig, which jimmy said the taste is exactly like the one he tried in the Philippines. Filipino BBQ chicken is also superb - the marinated sauce totally make it amazing.

Stating off in Manhattan which we visit plenty of both famous and hidden place all around like the whispering wall at Grand Central Station in NYC which is the location filmed in a couple of movies as well. 

We also got a chance to have a short walk sight seeing New York Public Library ( NYPL) We never planned to visit the public library while in New York City but we were walking right by on the fifth avenue so we went in and found out that This is not just the library It's like a museum !  Wandering around inside, we found out that it is actually the scene we saw in movie Day after Tomorrow and we were amazed by architecture, massive art work, and special exhibits., It is a place of refuge from the madness of  New York city.

We also visited the first major landscaped public park in the US. Get a thorough look into the heart of New York City, the Central Park in Manhattan.

➣ Las Vegas Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJjaOz9-3Wg&list=PL-wQeGXw6xB5CbRdXuxib0CgyIDLAy01j

This Las Vegas food vlog features the following Filipino restaurants, all of which are off-the-strip:

1) Tina's Filipino Cuisine - 7720 S Jones Blvd, Unit 105, Las Vegas, NV 89139, United States - Amazing lechon kawali! Crispy Pata is delish too though I still prefer D'Pinoy Joint for it. The lunch special is a great deal at Tina's Filipino Cuisine. I love that it doubles as a sari-sari store for Filipino goodies too.

2) Mang Felix Kitchen - 7080 S Rainbow Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89118, United States - I love that this Mang Felix Kitchen does both Filipino and Vietnamese food and not as a fusion! The Oxtail Pho is delicious with comforting broth and big pieces of oxtail. The Sizzling Pares is a must-try! Never saw Filipino beef pares made like this before. And the beef tapa is nice and flavourful (and not dry unlike most)!

3) D’Pinoy Joint - 7680 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89123, United States - D'Pinoy Joint is one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas for traditional Filipino food and has the most extensive menu of Filipino dishes for you to try! Their Bicol Express is one of the best I've had and the Crispy Pata is the best I've had in Las Vegas.

#SugboMercado, a night market located in I.T park Cebu City,
When we first saw ""night market"" on the map, we instantly thought of the night markets in Taipei we had visited a few weeks back, 
https://youtu.be/W6E1m6wV3UM

but we were surprised to find that it was m ore akin to the smorgasborg in new york city.
https://youtu.be/8K2gp6ZzN9A

It was certainly a pleasant surprise, filled with delicious food and very enthusiastic food vendors that are happy to talk to you about their culinary creations.

We found a variety and mix of food, from pasta to takoyaki, teobokki, noodles, pad Thai and lots and lots of barbecue, which is evident in the smokey and delicious air.

but we were determined to find some local food, so we each take 500 Piso, which we come to find out was way way too much, and we go out on a hunt for some local food.

sorry, no balut! (Daniel is happy about this)

We also opted to walk everywhere, which we found to be a lot more interesting, interacting with the local people.. no tourists! we loved it!

W9a4a1WXAuM,2022-08-04T06:00:10Z,UC8hiiGm6GTyTVvO-LtZ2Xmw,Street Food Philippines 2022! BEST LUGAW IN MALOLOS BULACAN? CHEAP Filipino Street Food - Lugaw Goto,"Lugaw or Porridge in general is traditionally thought of as food for the sick people due to the fact that it's bland, easy to eat, and fulfilling. It's also eaten for breakfast to start the day with a hearty warm bowl. Today, since I'm a little bit under the weather, we're going to start our Malolos Bulacan Food trip at Lugaw ni Abel! We had the following:

* Lugaw
* Laman
* Dila
* Tuwalya

Lugaw Ni Abel Address: A. Mabini St., Santisima Trinidad, Malolos, Philippines

A Taste of Manila is owned by Ed and Marjorie Giallombardo, and they host ""ghost kitchens"" and pop-up restaurants at bars, distilleries, and vendors around the Wausau, Wisconsin area. They thankfully invited @KatinaEatsKilos and I up to help kick off their new restaurant challenge as part of an event held at Timekeeper Distillery owned by their friends Dan and Kim. For this ""Sari Not Sorry"" Filipino Restaurant Eating Challenge, I had 45 minutes to feast on 8 giant pork lumpia, 2 softball-sized mounds of garlic fried rice, a giant portion of Filipino pancit with rice noodles and healthy vegetables, and 3 pieces of Filipino chicken adobo served with enough potatoes to fill up the plate. I enjoyed some optional dipping sauces plus 2 of their Westside Tasty Treat ice cream options - Mango Float and Berry Float. Both were yummy!! Courtesy of Timekeeper Distillery, I enjoyed a canned coattail with gin plus an old-fashioned made with bourbon. I was trying to become the 2nd person to win my $45 Filipino meal free plus a spot on the Wall of Fame!! Thanks to Ed & Marjorie with A Taste of Manila, Dan & Kim with Timekeeper Distillery, and everyone involved with the event for the delicious food, drinks, ice cream desserts, and hospitality!! Special thanks to everyone from around the Wausau area who came up to watch and meet us that January evening. We appreciate everyone in Wausau, WI and around Wisconsin who watches and supports our hard efforts!!

I had 45 minutes to finish lots of traditional Filipino foods which were so delicious!! There were 48 lumpia total which the food truck is known for, with 16 / Each of 3 different meats - chicken, pork, and beef. I also got to enjoy an adobo pulled pork sandwich, 1/2lb of Filipino pancit, 2 Siopao, a big handful of shrimp chips, and I tried drinking 3 delicious beers produced by Oak Road Brewery. I was trying to win my $100 Filipino food truck dinner free, a sweet t-shirt, and the first spot on Lola's Wall of Fame. Thank you to Mark and his wife (Lola's owners) and their team for the wonderful food and hospitality, and thanks also to Ben (owner of Oak Road Brewery) and his team for the delicious beers and drinks!!

After spending 5 months in Thailand we are now here in the Philippines where we create new up to date philippine travel videos and philippine travel vlogs for you all to enjoy and maybe learn a little on the way.

But since I've been constantly moving from country to country, it takes my body a couple of days to adjust to new, local dishes. I was craving Filipino food and luckily, someone I met earlier that week recommend Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant so I could satisfy my cravings!

The sizzling sisig and embutido dishes were more than I could've asked for and I couldn't have asked for a better Filipino experience in the heart of KL City :)

Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant Location: 3, Jalan Gereja, City Centre, 55000 Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

In this video, you’ll see my reactions and thoughts as a foreigner trying Jollibee for the first time in The Philippines. Jollibee is a Filipino staple, and one of the most popular things to try in the Philippines. I try all the Jollibee favourites for the very first time. 

There are NO Jollibee outlets in Australia - so, this is my genuine, very first reaction to even seeing Jollibee as a foreigner in the Philippines!

We’re about two-thirds of the way through our 21-day tour of Southeast Asia and so far we’ve experienced the beautiful city of Singapore, the world’s oldest Chinatown in Manila, the tribal lagoons of Coron, and the resort-heavy island of Boracay. Today, we’re packing up and heading southeast to experience the natural wonders of Bohol—and to find out why this destination is one of the most popular in the Philippines. But once again, getting there means first flying back up to Manila and then catching the connecting flight back down.

Unlike the tiny island of Boracay that we just left, Bohol is on the bigger side—it’s the 10th largest in the Philippines. It’s actually one big island and 75 minor surrounding islands. We flew into and staying on one of those minor islands—Panglao—just off the southwestern tip of the main island. In fact, it’s so close that you can drive to it using either of two bridges that span the causeway.

The most popular attraction in Bohol is Chocolate Hills: 1,776 limestone hills stretched over 50 square kilometers of the island. They are covered in green grass that turns brown during the dry season, hence the name. Formed by tectonic shifts that pushed them upwards and then smoothed into conical hills by water erosion. These iconic hills are even featured in the 200 Philippine Peso bill.

ABOUT US.

We’re a family with 3 kids, 5 careers, and endless passion for adventure. Two years ago, we decided it was time for Phil's ad agency to abandon the in-person, 5-day workweek. So they 86’d the office and work hours, allowing our own family to start traveling almost constantly. We now work, school, and explore in a different place every week—from our own mountain and beach homes to exotic villas, resorts, and yachts around the world. As we experience and support diverse cultures, we hope to inspire more families to design a life of freedom and adventure.

Because there’s a new American Dream. It’s one that’s void of templated expectations, templated career paths, templated education, templated families, templated homes, and templated lives. Freedom is no longer an American tagline—it’s just the new, global way of life.

Every day that you spend doing something that doesn’t fulfill you to your core, you’re living your life on pause. You’re deferring genuine family time with no guarantee that there will be a tomorrow or a someday. Some people follow that mentality their entire lives. We’ve chosen to never live that way again.

We appreciate you following our journey.

►Check out Anton’s channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/antondiaz
►Subscribe to my channel for more videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

The area around Quiapo Church, is home to a huge market, where you’ll find an abundance of especially clothing and street food - and ranging from fresh ingredients to cooked food ready to eat. If you love to eat, when you’re in Manila, Quiapo Market is one of the best places to start and get a feel for the city and eat some amazing Filipino street food.

We started right at Quiapo Church and it happened to be a Sunday afternoon - Anton mentioned that it’s usually the busiest on Sunday afternoon, catering to everyone that attends the hourly church service. We walked down one alley and ate two noodle dishes palabok (20 PHP, $0.40) and sotanghon (30 PHP, $0.60). Both dishes were good, and served fresh. I especially enjoyed the sotanghon, a cellophane noodles dish, that was cooked in flavorful oil and it was a perfect slurping dish.

Right in front of Quiapo Church in Manila, we at first though they were fish balls or squid balls, but they turned out to be chicken balls (2 PHP, $0.04 per ball). In order to eat Filipino chicken balls, you grab a stick, poke some on your stick, and dip in vinegar. They weren’t the best quality, but they weren’t expensive either. Next to the chicken balls, I saw the dried squid (10 PHP, $0.20 per stick) and had to try it as well. It was amazing, dried chewy squid, roasted over charcoal and dunked in chili vinegar.

We then walked across the main road at Quiapo and found a Filipino street food stall serving all types of kwek kwek (3 for 12 PHP, $0.24). Kwek kwek is a popular street food of quail eggs, coated in a thick batter and deep fried. We also tried 1 day old fried chickens (10 PHP, $0.20), which is another popular Filipino street food in that area of Manila. As with other Filipino snacks, you garnish with chilies, shallots, and lots of vinegar before eating.

Probably one of the most famous of all Philippines street food is balut (15 PHP, $.030), a duck egg embryo - like a half developed egg. You’ll find balut all over the Philippines and it’s especially popular to eat in the evening. The first thing you do is crack the top of the egg shell and drink the chicken soup. You then peel the rest of the egg, and eat both chick and the yolk on the inside. I also seasoned with a little salt and chili vinegar. I’ve eaten balut quite a few times during many trips to the Philippines, and I quite enjoy eating balut!

Quiapo Market is a wonderful place in Manila to explore all the street food snacks available, and it’s just an amazingly vibrant and colorful part of Manila, and it was great to hang out with Anton!

Thank you for watching!

►Subscribe to my channel for more food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

Aling Sosing's is often considered to be one of the best carinderias, or local Filipino food restaurants, in all of Manila. The crowd that shows up to eat lunch here everyday reinforces the fact that they are no doubt one of the spots you want to be in Manila, if you’re a food lovers. When I was eating in Manila, eating at Aling Sosing's was certainly among the best local Filipino food restaurants that I tried.

Aling Sosing's is a very typical type of local street food restaurant, sitting on the corner of a street, near to Makati. Just like most carinderias, all the food is prepared ahead of time, and sits at the front of the restaurant. When you arrive to order, you just simply pick and choose the different dishes that you want to order, find a table, and they will bring you the dishes to your table. Additionally, some of the famous dishes to eat at Aling Sosing's are off the grill, and you’ll smell the wonderful aroma of the grilling meats the entire time you’re eating, and it’s fantastic.

Ying and I arrived about 11 am on a weekday, and luckily we beat the main lunch traffic, but just barely. There were tables available when we arrived, but as soon as we sat down and order it filled up. Sof if you eat at Aling Sosing's Carinderia you might want to arrive before the main lunch rush. Additionally, some of the Filipino food dishes sell out fast, and they don’t cook them again for the day - once they are sold out, they are done for the day.

Here are the main Filipino dishes I ordered:
Pinakbet - A stew of mixed vegetables, oftentimes flavored with shrimp paste. This was the best versions of pinakbet I’ve ever had.
Inihaw na tilapia - The grilled tilapia is quite well known at this restaurant. It was simple and delicious.
Inihaw na liempo - The grilled pork belly is one of their signature dishes, and it’s every bit as good and smoky as it looks.
Kaldereta - A Filipino food I love so much is kaldereta, a goat stew, mainly because I love goat so much. It was oily, but really good.
Adobong pusit - I saw the squid the pot and decided to try it out. It was a little on the sweet side.
Pork BBQ - Fresh off the grill, Ying and I ordered some of their pork bbq. The pork was tender and lathered in bbq, it was amazing.

Total price - 640 PHP ($12.90)

If you’re looking for a local Filipino restaurant in Manila that I think serves some of the best Filipino food, Aling Sosing's is a restaurant you’re going to want to check out. The food is awesome, the setting and positive atmosphere is refreshing, and the constant smoke from the grill will keep your nose happy and wanting more!

Aling Sosing’s Carinderia
Address: Palanan 5819 Zobel Roxas, Palanan Makati City, Philippines
Open hours: 8 am - 6 pm from Monday - Saturday

►31 May - 4 June: If you happen to be in Manila from 31 May - 4 June, check out the World Street Food Congress 2017 event (http://wsfcongress.com/). There’s going to be some seriously delicious food from around the world there! I had another travel commitment during that time, so I won’t be able to attend, but I know the food will be awesome.

World Street Food Congress: http://wsfcongress.com/
KF Seetoh: https://www.instagram.com/kfseetoh/
Eat and Shout: https://www.instagram.com/eatandshout/
 
The World Street Food Congress and KF Seetoh from Singapore, invited me to attend a 15 hour Filipino food frenzy safari, and was excited to be a part of it! We started in Manila, then went to Pampanga for the main part of the tour, and then returned to Manila to eat more, and end with a grand finale lechon!

1. Bulaluhan sa España - We started off this Filipino food tour at about 7 am in Manila at a restaurant called Bulaluhan sa España, known for serving bulalo, a beef bone marrow soup. It was pretty tasty, a great way to get started, and my kind of a local restaurant.

2. Atching Lillian - Pampanga is known for being the food culinary capital of the Philippines, and we first went to Atching Lillian, who is legendary for preserving local cuisine. We had some interesting home-cooked Kampangan dishes, and some Filipino tamales.

3. Taldawa - This was probably my favorite stop on this Filipino food tour of Pampanga, a restaurant that specializes in goat and duck. The duck adobo and goat kaldereta were amazing.

4. 25 Seeds - On the food tour we had Chef Sau Del Rosario, a renowned Filipino chef from Pampanga, and just an awesome guy. We next went to his restaurant called 25 Seeds where we were treated to sisig paella, a creation by KF Seetoh and Chef Sau Del Rosario. It was an incredible combination.

5. Susie’s Cuisine - This place is well known throughout Pampanga for their Filipino desserts. I’m not big on desserts, but I tried a few bites, and that was about enough for me.

6. Makansutra Hawkers - Since this food tour event was also a press conference for the actual street food event, we then went to Makansutra Hawkers for a quick conference and more Malaysian / Singaporean food, which was excellent.
7. Zubuchon Lechon - I know there are infinite debates about Filipino lechon, or roast pig, but we went to a place that’s originally from Cebu, but they opened a branch in Manila, known as Zubuchon Lechon. It was pretty awesomely good, so extremely crunchy on the outside and creamy soft on the inside.

World Street Food Congress 2017 – If you’re in Manila from 31 May – 4 June 2017, don’t miss eating at World Street Food Congress 2017. It’s going to be a huge event, with a curated selection of street food hawkers that I can almost guarantee will impress your taste buds.

Thank you to Makansutra and the Philippine Department of Tourism for inviting me on this Filipino food tour!

First of all, I want to say a big thank you to my friend Reby for accompanying Ying and I on this Filipino street food tour of Quezon City. She loves to eat, and she’s just an awesome person!

Quezon City is a city next to Manila, and it’s actually a bigger city than Manila, but it’s part of Manila. So for this Filipino street food tour, I met up with my great friend Reby, who is from Quezon City, and we hit the streets to find some incredibly delicious food. Here’s everywhere we went and the dishes that we ate.

University of the Philippines Diliman - The University of the Philippines is known throughout Manila for its street food stalls, mainly because lots of students gather on campus to enjoy delicious food and hang out.

Rodic’s Diner - Tapsilog - 95 PHP ($1.91) - We began at Rodic’s Diner a legendary diner at University of Philippines and tried their legendary tapsilog. This is a well known Filipino food dish that includes cured carabao (water buffalo) meat, topped over rice, with a fried egg on top as well. It makes a great breakfast dish, and it was a great way to start the day off with. Outside of the student center, you’ll find some other Filipino street food carts selling snacks like cheese ice cream (20 PHP ($0.40) and cheese corn (20 PHP ($0.40).

Mang Larry's Isawan (Isaw - 60 PHP ($1.21) total) - Probaby the most famous street food at University of Philippines in Quezon City is Mang Larry's Isawan, a stall that serves grilled skewers of mostly pig and chicken intestines. The intestines and nice and clean, and grilled over hot fire, before you get them. When you get your skewers, you dip them in vinegar, or more like drown them in vinegar, and eat. They were truly incredible, like little bites of hollow crunchy sausage.

Lagro Market - Continuing our Filipino street food tour of Quezon City, Reby brought us to a local market called Lagro Market. As soon as we arrived I noticed one of the coolest rotisserie chicken street food carts that I’ve ever seen, and we had to make a stop and try some of their chicken (lechon manok (roast chicken). The chicken was alright, a little dry, but tasty, and the setting and atmosphere, plus the chicken street food cart, was very cool. Half chicken - 85 PHP ($1.71).

Buko (30 PHP ($0.60) - Buko is the word for young coconut, and there’s nothing more refreshing than a young coconut on the streets of Manila.

Mango shrimp paste (7 PHP ($0.14) per piece) - Although this is a humble easy Filipino street food snack, it’s one of my favorites. A sour green mango is cut, then topped with spicy shrimp paste and you eat it like a caramel apple. 

Marawi, Mindanao, Philippines Food - We ended this Filipino food tour by going to a random street food stall that we came across, located across the street from the market. The little stall was serving a type of cuisine from Marawi, located on the Southern Philippines island of Mindanao. It was also Halal food, and they had a variety of typical Filipino food dishes like adobo, but also some Filipino dishes I had never tried before due to the regional differences. Although it looks simple and humble, Reby, Ying and I, all thought the food was fantastic. These are the type of street food stalls that I love to eat at most! Total price - 230 PHP ($4.62)

Thank you again to Reby for showing us around and for the delicious Filipino food tour of Quezon City!

►Subscribe to my YouTube channel for more food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►Follow my Instagram for current updates: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/

Pochok Bangusan is a local carinderia in Quezon City that serves an amazing version of grilled bangus, which is grilled milkfish, and it happens to be one of my personal favorite things to eat in the Philippines. The local restaurant is family fun, and they have all the typical Filipino food dishes set up and pre-cooked at the front of the restaurant when you arrive. All the dishes you can point to and choose from are delicious, but the real magic of eating at Pochok Bangusan is their grilled milkfish. Milkfish is the national fish of the Philippines, and it’s something that you have to eat when you’re there.

To make their grilled bangus (milkfish), they first flame grilled the fish, and I mean when he stuck it on the grill, it ignited into flames as the oiliness of the fish touched the hot coals. The fire was also fanned to keep it flaming hot throughout the grilled process. After grilling the fish on both sides, he then flipped it over on the skin side down, and topped it with a few heaping spoons of green tomato relish. The fish was creamy and sort of dry like a tuna, and the green tomato topping was sour and oniony. It was a perfect combination of ingredients.

Along with the grilled milkfish, Ying and I also chose a number of other Filipino food dishes that were already prepared including chicken organs adobo (I would highly recommend it if you like organs like we do), menudo which was a little different than any other version of menudo I’ve had, bulalo which is a famous Filipino food of bone marrow soup, and another of the of my favorite Filipino dishes that I tried for the first time, which was a roasted eggplant topped in krill paste / shrimp paste, and topped with a handful of chopped green mango. 

The combination of all the foods we ordered, and especially the grilled milkfish, is was really made eating at Pochok Bangusan so memorable. Additionally, the family that runs the carinderia (local Filipino food restaurant / street food restaurant) were very friendly and you could tell that they enjoyed the food they were cooking and their customers.

If you’re looking for wonderful Filipino local food in Manila (it’s actually in Quezon City, but in Metro Manila), Pochok Bangusan is a fantastic place to eat.

Thanks to https://coconuts.co/manila/food-drink/carinderia-crawl-e22-grilled-bangus-and-bulalo-pochok-bangusan/ for the recommendation.

►Best Filipino street food: https://migrationology.com/filipino-street-food-philippines/
 
Mang Tootz Food House is a famous Philippines food restaurant in Manila, located in the heart of the city next to University of Santo Tomas. Because it’s next to a major university, it attracts quite a crowd of hungry students everyday, along with anyone else passing by and ready to eat a delicious Filipino food meal and some of the best banana egg rolls (turon) you’ll ever try.
 
Mang Tootz Food House is a carinderia, a local style eatery, and to eat you go up to the front of the restaurant and pick and choose the different dishes you want to try. I got a plate of Bicol express, inihaw na liempo, sisig, chicken kebab, ginataang langka, and finally, their banana rhuma, which is what they call their version of banana egg rolls, or banana lumpia, or turon.
 
Out of the Filipino dishes I ordered, the Bicol express, a Filipino stew of pork with coconut milk and chilies, and the ginataang langka, a jackfruit stew with coconut milk, were my favorite dishes of the meal. The chicken kebab wasn’t my favorite dish as it was covered in a mayonnaise tasting sauce.
 
Banana-rhuma (turon) - Ok finally, when you eat at Mang Tootz Food House, the one sure thing you have to order is their banana rhuma. These little banana egg rolls are amazing, and you’ll see them at the front of the restaurant being made and deep friend. Many people come by in the afternoon and order only the banana egg rolls, just as a snack to go. They take a lumpia wrapper, place a piece of banana on the inside, wrap it up, and deep fry it in a wok to a crispy golden crunch. The banana egg rolls are then stir fried with a caramel like mixture,and sprinkled with sesame seeds. I’m not a big sweets lover, but when Filipino turon are hot and fresh, they are truly amazing, and these were the best I’ve ever tried.
 
Total price for meal - 365 PHP ($7.34)

►Follow my Instagram for current updates: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/

Binondo, which is Chinatown in Manila, Philippines, is one of the best places to eat when you’re in Manila. You’ll find a good range of Chinese Filipino food, and overall, I was pleasantly surprised how friendly, clean, and nice it was. Binondo is also known to be the world’s oldest Chinatowns, and it really has some old style charm to it, and some delicious food to eat.

On this particular Manila Chinatown food tour, my wife Ying and I set off in the morning to just walk around and eat what we saw. I had done some research and wrote down some places to eat, but we were just going to go ourselves and get a feel for walking around and see if we could find any other food. About halfway through the day, we were filming, and we randomly bumped in Nathan who watches our videos. He not only is from Manila, but he’s also from Manila Chinatown, and he brought us around for the rest of this food tour - so big thank you to Nathan and his fiance!

Here are the place we ate on this Chinese Filipino food tour of Manila Chinatown (Binondo):

Dong Bei Dumplings - This restaurant is legendary in Chinatown Manila for their pork and chive dumplings - 150 PHP ($3.01). The dumplings seemed a little on the expensive side, but they were pretty awesomely delicious. It was a great way to start this Binondo food tour.

Estero Fast Food - Next, we stopped at a restaurant called Estero fast food, serving all sorts of Chinese Filipino street food. We ordered buttered chicken, fried frog legs, stuffed squid, and finally mixed vegetables. The food was all OK, nothing really stand out to me, and wasn’t a huge fan of the buttered chicken. Total price - 650 PHP ($13.05)

Ho-Land Hopia and Bakery - This is a legendary bakery in Manila’s Binondo, and they are especially known for their original mung bean pastry hopia. Hopia original - 48 PHP ($0.96)

New Po Heng Lumpia House - After meeting up with Nathan and his fiance, we headed first to go eat some lumpia. The lumpia was excellent, among the best fresh Chinese lumpia I’ve ever had. Lumpia - 60 PHP ($1.20)

Siopao - Nathan knew of this hole in the wall spot, and their siopao were delicious, so fluffy and packed with flavor. Price - 20 PHP ($0.40)

Serry Restaurant - Eating at Serry Restaurant in Binondo was the highlight of this Manila Chinatown food tour for me. We first had Soup Number Five (Soup #5), a notorious bull penis soup, and it was actually incredibly delicious. I loved it. Also, the black chicken soup was incredibly good, very herbal and very clean tasting. Total price - 280 PHP ($5.62)

899 Restaurant - Finally, to end this Chinatown tour, Nathan took us to one of his favorite restaurants in Binondo called 899, especially to eat pig intestines and braised tongue. The tongue was absolutely sensational, while both the big and small intestines were also delicious. Total price - 650 PHP ($13.05)

When you’re in Manila, walking around Binondo, Manila’s Chinatown, is one of the best things to do. You’ll find some great food, and it’s just a fun place to walk around and explore on foot. Thank you to Nathan for his help in this video!

Manila, Philippines ➖ Ever since I started solo travelling in 2019, the Philippines has been at the top of the list of places I wanted to visit. I'm so stoked to finally be here after years of waiting and hearing so many amazing things about this place. I am staying here in Binondo, also known as Chinatown, and it's absolutely awesome here. So, I decided to check out a local market known as Divisoria to get a real taste of what it's like here in Manila. The traffic is crazy, there are tons of markets, and the people are some of the nicest I've met, it is indeed, ""more fun in the Philippines!"".

We’ve finally made it to PHILIPPINES’ BIG CITY and we decided to travel around to some of Manila’s best neighborhoods during our FIRST TIME in Manila and see  the best things to do in Manila! #manila #firstimpressions #philippines  

Starting out on our Manila Philippines Tour in beautiful Makati Manila, we head over to the Manila Sunday Market, Legazpi Market to get a taste of a more local side of Manila’s financial center and kick off our time in Metro Manila with a Manila food tour.   

Next up we headed to Manila Chinatown to Indulge in Manila Philippines Street Food, where you can find a variety of delicious treats in a Binondo food trip. We also made a stop over to the Luckytown Mall in Chinatown to get out of the heat and humidity during our Manila Philippines city tour.

We wrap up our first day at the iconic Intramuros Manila, a historic walled city within the city, and visit its most famous and oldest stone church in the Philippines. We ended up our night on top of the Bayleaf Hotel to admire the stunning views of the city and sunset overlooking the famous Manila Bay.

We finish up on a second day back in Makati City Philippines for one last halo halo during our time in the Philippines. People originally told us not to spend much time in Manila, but our FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF MANILA left us extremely impressed and we are glad to have explored the city!

Finding a Filipino restaurant was more difficult than we could possibly imagine. Most of the restaurants on Siargao Island are western. We did find a traditional filipino restaurant in the end and it was definitely worth the wait. Sisig, Inasal, Crispy Pata, Taba ng talangka, Pancit Palabok Bulalo, Lechon, Adobo. 
Our first day on Siargao Island and we have fallen in love. This place is so chilled... so friendly. This is our favourite Island so far. We will be exploring the beautiful Island of Siargao for the next few days so please follow along on our journey. Any recommendations appreciated... Thank you Philippines... the Filipino people have been amazing! 🖤

We are Eleise and Lawrence & Nyh – A young family from the south of England. Like many people the pandemic gave us a shake up! While watching hours of Mark Weins in Thailand – We had our “Ah ha” Moment. We decided we wanted to travel.
Enjoying working for ourselves, we didn’t want to give up our business and decided it was entirely possible for us to do both. So we set about making it our lifestyle to work in the UK for a month, and then travel for a month – month on, month off…. until our little boy Nyh goes to school! We want to inspire people that you don’t have to up-sticks, sell all your belongings and leave behind family to be able to see the world.

Our Philosophy. Work, Travel, Repeat.

We are Eleise and Lawrence & Nyh – A young family from the south of England. Like many people the pandemic gave us a shake up! While watching hours of Mark Weins in Thailand – We had our “Ah ha” Moment. We decided we wanted to travel.
Enjoying working for ourselves, we didn’t want to give up our business and decided it was entirely possible for us to do both. So we set about making it our lifestyle to work in the UK for a month, and then travel for a month – month on, month off…. until our little boy Nyh goes to school! We want to inspire people that you don’t have to up-sticks, sell all your belongings and leave behind family to be able to see the world.

Our Philosophy. Work, Travel, Repeat.

Ja2nNDd9fjg,2023-03-29T02:00:12Z,UCeJ5AjddCuEnZxtUggbzeDA,"AMERICAN FAMILY tries JOLLIBEE For The FIRST TIME in Manila, Philippines 🇵🇭 | McDONALD'S vs JOLLIBEE","The moment you all have been waiting for! Well, maybe it’s the moment the kids have been waiting for… McDonald's vs Jollibee! This Manila, Philippines, fast food challenge is on! We normally prefer delicious Filipino street food, but we had heard so much about Jollibee that we had to give it a try. There is a Jollibee in Dubai, but we never went to it while we lived there. In fact, the whole Filipino food scene in Dubai is probably something we need to go back and explore.

In this video, we knew we had to compare a McDonald’s cheeseburger to Jolliibee’s cheeseburger. That is Granite’s favorite and top pick. Then, we found two items from McDonald’s that we had never seen before - fried chicken and spaghetti. We knew instantly that we had to use those in our food challenge. Unfortunately, Kelly didn’t find any vegetarian options, so she compared the french fries. Join us at Rizal Park, as we have this delicious taste off between Jollibee and McDonald’s. See who prefers what, you may be surprised.

This is the Intramuros - or walled city - district dating back to the 1500s. We began our day with a delicious hearty silog breakfast. Just down the street, all within walking distance, we were able to visit the historical San Angustin Church, the Manila Cathedral, and Fort Santigo. We even walked down into the dungeons of the Fort, which definitely gave us a creepy vibe. After exploring there, we headed back to the Rizal Park area for delicious Filipino street food. Granite enjoyed deep-fried quail eggs (known as kwek-kwek) and Kelly found a palm sugar tofu treat (called Taho).

Manila, Philippines, has a huge variety of food options and street food restaurants. In the time that we have, we will try to explore as many of those neighborhoods as possible. In this video, we spend the day exploring Binondo (Chinatown) in Manila. We find so much delicious Chinese street food and we are able to feed our family just by sampling a variety of different dishes. When we get to a new place, we like to eat a sampling of yummy foods. If we eat one big meal, then we miss out on so many different dishes. That is why you will see us split and share dishes when we are exploring street foods and local small businesses. 

Today, we make 7 different stops for street food! Check out the time stamps listed below for the names of each stop we made. It takes us all day, but we are happy and have full tummies. If you are in Manila, add the Binondo Chinatown neighborhood to your stop. The food is fantastic and we were only able to scratch the service of what there is here.

This place was busy with a younger crowd, with lots of music and action going on. The entire street is just one food vendor after another. We really only spent time on this one street, so I’m sure we missed a lot, as well. We were able to get a taxi here and back to our hotel with no problem. There were many tuk-tuk trucks passing through there, too. We never figured out how to get on one of those, so that is something we will have to try when we come back. In this video, we eat, eat, and eat some more. We had fried foods, meat on a stick, popcorn, empanadas, and the dessert YOU suggested: Halo Halo! Kelly found a twister potato (and off camera she found fresh chili and garlic peanuts). It was a full night of eating. We met so many fun kids running around. 

We love that YOU get to join us around the world. The Bags Packed Family community has grown so much over the last few months and we appreciate all of your support. Stick with us as we explore more of the Philippines, heading to Cebu and Palawan soon.

It is famous for the Quiapo Church and the annual festival of the Black Nazarene. Quiapo is also known for its variety of cheap eats and delicious street food. In this video, we go in search of street food. We make many stops ranging from soups, sweets, and fried or grilled meats. Forest finds a delicious dragon fruit juice stand and later makes friends with the sweetest street vendor. It is a full day of eating! The flavors and textures are fantastic contrasts of sticky rice and grilled squid, fried fish balls, and mini “martabak-style” pancakes. We were actually in search of balut, a poached chicken embryo. Unfortunately, we never found it in Quiapo. Who knows, we probably passed it without even knowing it (or maybe it is served at a specific time of day)? However, we did find it days later, and we can’t wait to show you that video. 

We love that YOU get to join us around the world. The Bags Packed Family community has grown so much over the last few months and we appreciate all of your support. Stick with us as we explore more street food options in Manila, plus we visit a mall and an amusement park.

It's the tip of paradise where people spend the day out on boats island hopping. As people who work as we travel, we spent much of our time here working under deadline (and pinching ourselves at how lucky we are to do so in such a paradise!). For that reason, we tended to eat whatever was close to our Airbnb that was fast and easy. We found lots of delicious places for quick eats, including our neighbourhood coffee shop...very important! ☕️

We look for food to get for brunch and take it home to eat. We get to try fresh mango and an avocado smoothie made with avocado, condensed milk, and crushed ice. We also visit an enormous nearby church called the Monastery of the Holy Eucharist or Simala Church. People come from all over the Philippines to bring offerings for the Virgin Mary in exchange for miracles. We couldn't get over the sheer size of this church. It's been expanded to accommodate the thousands of people who regularly visit. Have you ever seen anything like it?

NEDLWRSapp0,2023-07-01T12:00:14Z,UCguRKiLcbY9yIG9fxmd9BuQ,Trying My Husband's Favorite Filipino Foods (Bacolod Food Tour),"We are headed on a self-led Filipino food tour in Bacolod, Philippines so I can try Mico's favourite Filipino foods in his hometown! Bacolod City is regarded as one of the best places to eat in all of the Philippines, and they have some incredible iconic dishes and restaurants here. Bacolod City is most well known for being the creator of chicken inasal, which happens to be Mico's favourite food in the world! To get the highest quality chicken inasal, we went to Makbang Country, which translates to chicken country. Chicken inasal sounds simple - it's essentially BBQ chicken, BUT between the special marinade, the iconic chicken oil, and the dipping sauce that only Filipinos know how to make, chicken inasal becomes so much more than just BBQ chicken. Not to mention that the parts of the chicken you eat are...well... not what this Canadian-raised woman is used to. Mico wasn't going to let me get away without trying tinae (intestine) and atay (liver) in addition to the more-familiar paa (leg). 

Something you may not know about Filipino food it that it is meat HEAVY. Like...really heavy! Filipino food is the most meat heavy cuisine we have ever come across, so of course, our second dish of the day was soup made with a massive beef bone. The dish is called cansi, and we went to Sharyn's Cansi House to try it (Sharyn's Cansi House is famous for the dish in Bacolod). The difference between this beef soup and others I've tried is the bone marrow... which Mico so kindly shows me how to eat Filipino-style.,

Batchoy was dish #3, and it was really surprising. It is filled with pancit noodles, which really excited me because pancit is my favourite Filipino food! As soon as I took my first bite of batchoy I was totally surprised. It was not at all what I expected, but I was happy to have a little less meat in my meal 😂

Our last dish may not have been classically Filipino, but it is very famous in Bacolod City and came highly recommended by many locals from Bacolod. It was a delicious dessert dish that we got from Calea, and it was the perfect way to cap off our Filipino food tour!

We headed to Quiapo market here in Manila in search of our first Filipino Halo Halo. 

Ended up in Jolli dada's eatery just outside the Quiapo market and ordered 2 Halo Halo at 80 PHP each. 

I've gotta say it was alright but I was expecting more it wasn't too sweet and just not as flavourful as the shaved ice desserts we've had in numerous other countries. 

We then bought some ground Filipino coffee across the road, we payed about 150 PHP for some Sagada coffee from Northern Luzon and it's pretty good.

On the way home we stopped at an absolute classic Filipino street food stall for some Kwek Kwek and Siomai. 

The people running this stall in Binondo are super nice and friendly and the food is alright it fills a hole and is super cheap we spent 70 PHP on some Kwek Kwek, Siomai and a coconut juice.

Is this REALLY the WORLD'S BEST CHICKEN and fast-food chain? Our SUBSCRIBERS said WE MUST TRY the EPIC FILIPINO fast-food chain for the FIRST TIME while we are RIGHT HERE in Manila, Philippines!! WE ORDERED EVERYTHING ON THE MENU. This is SURPRISINGLY more TALKED about THAN HALO-HALO here in Manila, Philippines. JOLLIBEE is a Filipino franchise restaurant and the locals can’t seem to get enough of it and apparently the same is said in over 34 COUNTRIES and is one of the FASTEST growing RESTAURANTS in THE WORLD! Of course WE HAD to TRY it right here where it first started in the Philippines!  You simply could not come to Philippines without trying it!! Let's see if JOLLIBEE lives up to all of the HYPE and is as DELICIOUS as everyone keeps telling us it is. 
WE ARE huge KFC fans and EAT IT IN EVERY COUNTRY WE VISIT… will the CHICKEN live up to all of the HYPE?!

IsgC81D2O8w,2023-09-17T11:24:23Z,UCKygRpISlqs5TufcT3JtRng,Hungry Vlogger's 48 hour Filipino Street Food Binge 🇵🇭,"I started my Filipino street food adventure in the Malate area of Manila, looking for some Pancit.

Before I could find a pancit restaurant I found a street vendor selling ube ice cream. It's not a good idea to eat sweet food before a meal, but I couldn't resist. I love the taste of ube, the purple yam that's used in so many Filipino desserts, and had never tried it in ice cream before.

While buying the ice cream cone, another vendor sold me a pack of boiled quail eggs, and they came in useful later.

I strolled around the Malate area, enjoying my ice cream, then got back to my original mission, the Pancit hunt.

I found a restaurant on Google Maps, Rita's Pancit Malabon. It seems that there are many varieties of Pancit and Pancit Malabon is one of them.

The Pancit Malabon that I was served was a bowl of rice noodles, soaked in a yellow sauce that was tangy, fishy and spicy. Not what I was expecting at all, but tasty nonetheless. And that's where the quail eggs came in, as I added them to my bowl of pancit for extra flavour and protein!

The pancit meal was quite salty, so I went on the hunt for a refreshing drink. I came across a vendor selling a mysterious black liquid they said was Gulaman. I had no idea what it was, and after tasting it I have no idea how to describe it. At only 10 pesos per cup it's a bargain though.

Strolling towards Dolomite Beach with my cup of Gulaman in hand, I found some more street food that I couldn't resist. Turon is a hot, crispy delicious banana spring roll. Deep fried and delicious.

I'd eaten the Turon before at the Filipino Mall in Kuala Lumpur, so I knew what it was and I knew it was tasty. The Manila street food version of Turon was a huge portion size and covered in caramel. What an incredible sweet treat.

I took a walk past the American embassy and Dolomite beach, when I met a magician who was keen to show me his tricks. He entertained me so I bought a couple of his overpriced magic tricks and took them back to my hotel to play with.

After a late afternoon swim in the New Coast Hotel swimming pool, I was back out in Malate for a haircut and trip to Denny's but that wasn't included in the vlog.

The next day my Filipino street food adventure continued and I enjoyed some Tapsilog from a local restaurant.

Tapsilog is a combination of Tapa and Silog. Tapa is something like a beef jerky and Silog is rice and egg. It's a meal that's normally eaten for breakfast but is nice at any time of the day in my opinion.

After that salty meal I was again on the hunt for a cold drink, and again found a vendor selling Gulaman. I'd never heard of it before but it must be a popular drink in the Philippines.

After avoiding some tourist scammers on the streets of Malate, I bargained for a Trike ride to Divisoria market. They were asking me for 500 pesos, but I had a good idea of what the real price was and ended up paying 200 pesos. The price for an air conditioned car on the Grab app was 285 pesos, so they were really trying it on asking me for 500 for the trike ride.

At Divisoria market I bought myself a cool new baseball cap, enjoyed a Graham Fudge Sundae at Jollibee and then enjoyed a nice sunset stroll back to my Malate hotel. Walking is surely faster than being in rush hour traffic anyway!

From the menu to the amenities, we found many differences that we hadn't realized before. It was interesting to compare and contrast the two restaurants, and we hope you'll find this video interesting too!

Whilst doing some shopping in Mindoro’s outside market, I stumbled across locals who sold some of the freshest food I have seen on the island. This I had to film! As I started to roll tape my market excursion quickly turned into an interesting little culinary experience.

Their language was hard to understand, but I pushed through. Luckily the mic on my camera works far better than my ear under such noisy circumstances and caught the whole experience on tape for you guys to hear. Enjoy ;-)

(Touching),"■ DALAHICAN, SAN JOSE, ROXAS, ORIENTAL MINDORO, PHILIPPINES: Subscribe and follow me as I invade a Filipino home with the most hard-working people you will ever meet! You won't believe how they live 🇵🇭. 

Nothing beats seeing how people live. NOTHING! Whilst touring the Philippines I often rode past little communities of houses barely standing in close proximity to rivers and the ocean. I just never got around to visiting one. 

When I was touring Mindoro, an island in the Philippines, I once walked past such a community. Sadly, I was on a deserted section of the beach. This wasn't the day for a 'J.C. Invades,' until I turned the corner and came upon these outdoor houses and decided to try to learn more about how they lived. 

After an hour of viewing how pulang buntot fish were rationed throughout the village and climbing my way up a destroyed home, I gained natural courage and started to roll tape. This is what ensued.....

필리핀 산 속에 있는 마을로 저희 집 가사도우미로 있는 젠젠의 고향이며
필리핀 락다운으로 3개월 11일만에 집에 가게 되었습니다.
저희가 아이까지 데리고 간 이유는
아직까지 대중교통이 금지되어 있어 가사도우미가 집에 갈 수 있는 방법이 없었습니다.
저희가 직접 가지 않으면 언제 갈 수 있을지 모르는 상황입니다.
그래서 최대한 코로나에 조심하며 방문했습니다.

젠젠의 집 주변에는 야자수가 많아 코코넛은 언제든지 먹을 수 있는 환경이며
시내로 나가려면 차로 30분을 이동해야 포장도로가 나오고
거기서 30분을 내려가야 시내가 나옵니다.

닭은 필리핀 누구나 키우는 동물로 언제나 많은 닭을 볼 수 있습니다.
다만 시끄럽다는 것...


오늘도 저희 영상을 시청해주셔서 대단히 감사드립니다.

In a rural village in the Philippines, a village where foreigners never came.
This is the first visit by a Korean couple.
It is the hometown of Jenjen, who is a housekeeper in the Philippines.
I went home after 3 months and 11 days to Rockdown in the Philippines.
The reason we took her with us is because...
There was no way for a housekeeper to go home because public transportation was still prohibited.
We don't know when we can go unless we go in person.
So I visited Corona as carefully as possible.

There are many palm trees around Jenjen's house, so coconut can be eaten anytime.
Get to town 30 minutes by car and paved roads have to travel.
It takes 30 minutes from there to get to downtown.

Everyone in the Philippines has chickens and can always see many chickens.
It's just loud...

TV에서 보는 코코넛은 정말 환상적인 맛처럼 보여지고
실제로 관광을 와서 먹는 코코넛은 뭔가 아쉽다고 느껴지곤 했습니다.
그래서 기회가되어 코코넛을 바로 따서 먹어보았는데 과연 맛은 어떨지!!

필리핀 세부 시골마을에 방문한 세부부부의 이야기 시작합니다.

What about the taste of coconuts eaten directly in nature? This time, I tried it in a jungle-like country village in the Philippines.
The coconuts you see on TV look fantastic.
I used to feel sorry for the coconuts that I actually ate on sightseeing.
So I got a chance to pick the coconut and eat it right away. How does it taste?

The story of Cebu couple visiting Cebu rural village in the Philippines begins.

Davao City has some tasty food and we went on a huge food tour eating a whole Filipino durian, satay and bulalo throughout the city.

👀 WATCH I Spent My Birthday at Mcdonalds in the Philippines!: https://youtu.be/EtkPVsWpXbU

We started off our ultimate street food tour in Davao City Philippines trying satti. Filipino satay is covered in a thick, sweet, spicy and savoury sauce that’s thick like gravy and oh so delicious! A great breakfast that’s for sure. After our satay, we went to try the popular Filipino food bulalo at a popular shop here in Davao City. Served many times to the former president Duterte, this popular bulalo shop serves a bulalo that’s so massive you definitely need to share.

Known as the durian capital of the Philippines, the durian here is abundant and affordable. We headed down to the local fruit stands to get a whole Filipino durian to share. Eating a whole Filipino durian is probably one of the highlights of our visit so far, we love the taste and flavour, just so delicious! 

Last stop on our ultimate street food tour in Davao City Philippines was to taste some tuna belly and kinilaw. Davao tuna was a great way to end our  street food tour in Davao!

We hope you enjoy this ultimate street food tour in Davao City Philippines, eating whole Filipino durian and trying the local satti Filipino satay and bulalo. Stay tuned for more street food adventures!

Sometimes they would go for weeks at a time only having yams to eat. Over time, Mary Joy became malnourished.

""I help out on my parents' small farm to bring home a little food for my daughter,"" Myrna told us. ""But with nothing but yams, Mary Joy started getting sick and weak.""

""I wanted to help my mom plant vegetables,"" said the little girl. ""But I have to stay home when I'm sick.""

One year, two powerful typhoons hit the Philippines and destroyed Mary Joy and Myrna's home. The mother and daughter fled their home and took shelter at Myrna's parents' home.

""I was scared,"" remembered Mary Joy. ""The wind was so strong it shook grandma's house. After the storm, my cousins and I all slept on one bed. My mom slept on the cold floor.""

""I had no idea how I would be able to rebuild our home,"" said Myrna. ""All the crops on our family farm had been completely washed away in the storm.""

Then, Orphan's Promise came to their community. First, we established a food program for Mary Joy and the other malnourished children in the community.

""The chicken and squash taste good,"" said the little girl with a smile.

""I'm glad Mary Joy gets to eat food that we cannot afford to serve at home,"" said her mother. ""Since the Orphan's Promise feeding program began, she hasn't been getting sick anymore.""

But, we didn't stop there. We gave Myrna everything she needed to start a worm farm. The operation allows Myrna to make and sell organic compost to all the farmers in her community, and business is booming! Last but not least, we made sure the mother and daughter had a safe place to live; Orphan's Promise built the two a brand new home to live in!

""We have much more space to move around,"" said Myrna. ""Our new home is a symbol of hope for us. I am very grateful to God who has given me a second chance to be able to provide for my daughter.""

""Thank you very much,"" exclaimed the little girl.

This story first aired January 2016.

jrppaG01-F0,2021-04-17T07:00:18Z,UCFvQ_bDaalb-1ZyCb48LCpA,Cooking Filipino Food for my Slovak Family! Did they like it? | I will teach you how to cook Lugaw!,"Hi Guys!

If you wanna try and cook Lugaw as well, here are the ingredients I used.

1 Cup Glutinous Rice / Sticky Rice
3 Thumbs Ginger
4 Cloves Garlic
1 Bulb Onion
6-7 Cups Water/Broth (may add more if necessary)
3 Tbspn Cooking Oil
1 Kilo Chicken Thigh (any part you like)
Salt & Pepper to taste
Roasted Garlic and Chopped Spring Onions for garnish

Optional:
Hard Boiled egg
Crispy Fried Pork and Tofu as side
Sauce : Soysauce, Vinegar and Onion with dash of Ground Black pepper

Steps how to cook Lugaw

1. Saute Onion, Garlic and Ginger.
2. Cook Chicken thigh (or any part of chicken you like) and season it with Salt and pepper, cook for 20 minutes
3. Add water or chicken broth.
4. Add the Glutinous or sticky rice (if Sticky rice is not available, you can use normal rice)
5. Bring to boil and cook the rice for another 20 minutes, checking and stirring occasionally. You may have to add water or broth if needed.
6. Season with Salt and Pepper.
7. Cook until chicken is tender and rice is thick.

For Garnish I add roasted garlic and chopped spring onion on top with boiled egg and dashed of ground Black pepper.

You may eat it with Fried Tofu and Pork belly on side with Soy sauce, Vinegar and Onion as a dipping Sauce like what I did in the video.

This is totally optionally but I highly recommend it :)

I hope you guys will like this Lugaw and tell me if you would try it as well!

Earlier this month, Baon Kainan, meaning “to-go eatery” in Tagalog, joined Vietnamese food cart Matta, as the latest addition to the lot at Metalwood Salvage on Northeast Prescott Street. But you won’t find lumpia and pancit on the menu. At least for now. Owners and newlyweds Ethan and Geri Leung, both 31, serve up their own twist to classic Filipino cuisine, while paying homage to their heritage. “It is an expression of what we grew up with as Filipino Americans,” Geri explained. And while they always start off with how their moms would make a dish, their tagline states that the food is “not your tita’s cooking.”

If you don’t already know, Sinigang is a Filipino dish that consists of meat and an assortment of vegetables, all cooked in a tamarind-based broth. Beef Sinigang is Rei’s favorite kind, but it's pretty seldom that we make it because it takes forever to make the beef tender. But, in this recipe, we’re going to show you how to cook it with an Instant Pot so that you’ll get to eat tender Beef Sinigang in a pinch!

Just reading that sentence makes my mouth water! This dish is the perfect blend of savory with a hint of tart. The way we make this dish is exactly how my mom prepared it as a kid. I like to think the extra steps give it a little extra somethin’ somethin’! We hope you like it as much as we do!

It's a sour soup that when you cook the vegetables  turns brown. In the Philippines we can use fresh fruits to cook this soup to make it sour. We have tamarind, we have guava, kamias and other sour fruit. But we also have those store bought powder that we can easily use. You can use any kinds of vegetables you want on this soup there is no limit and you can use any protein too. Beef, pork or seafood they are all good for this kind of soup. Here in Bosnia we dont have asian store so when I make Sinigang I used lemon juice. It has more of a tart flavor than sour but its still good. Luckily husband bought some sinigang powder in Zagreb last time and some Filipino friends also gave me. If you dont like your greens will turn brown you can blanch it on the soup that is not  yet sour so that it will retain its green color and then you just add them at the last part just like what I did in the video.

Hi fellas welcome back❤️ It's breakfast time! 
I had fun making this video and I hope you will enjoy too. 
Though not all Slovenian eat this type of breakfast, it's very common. Many of them also just have a coffee in the morning like me! I don't really eat breakfast on a daily basis here and in the Philippines but when I do, these are some of what I'll definitely have. 
Get your breakfast now and eat with me 😉

I recommend turning on subtitle and playing the video on 1080p.

Grilled Pork Belly | Filipino Style

These grilled strips of pork belly, or Inihaw na Liempo, are marinated in a classic Filipino barbecue flavor that is sweet, savory, and slightly tangy. Although typically cooked over a charcoal grill, you can conveniently grill them in the oven, too.

Equipment

Convection oven, grill, or air fryer
Baking Sheet

Ingredients

2 pounds pork belly slices ½""-thick
⅓ cup + 1 tablespoon soy sauce, regular or light
¼ cup lemon or calamansi juice
⅓ cup packed brown sugar sub: any sugar
¼ cup banana or tomato ketchup
6 cloves garlic minced or grated
Black pepper to taste

Dipping Sauce:

¼ cup distilled white or cane vinegar
1 tablespoon minced shallot sub:red onion
Bird's eye chilies to taste; chopped
1 teaspoon sugar
Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions

1. Combine soy sauce, calamansi or lemon juice, brown sugar, ketchup, garlic, and ground pepper (to taste).
2. Marinate pork belly slices and refrigerate for 4 to 8 hours.
3. Preheat oven to 425° F (218° C). Line a baking sheet with double layers of aluminum foil to make cleanup easier.
4. Arrange pork belly slices in a single layer and bake them for 20 minutes.
5. Over medium heat, cook leftover marinade for about 10 minutes until slightly thickened to prevent cross-contamination.
6. Remove the meat from the oven and brush it with basting sauce on both sides. Return it to the oven for another 20 minutes. Adjust baking time based on the thickness of the meat. The thinner the slices, the faster they cook.
7. To caramelize the outside, broil on low for about 3 minutes. Be careful not to burn them.
8. To make sawsawan or dipping sauce, combine the vinegar, shallot, chilies, sugar, salt, and pepper to taste.

My husband and I just visited Seafood City in Chicago to do a little grocery shopping for Filipino goods. It's been a long while since we've done this as we are still trying to adapt to the ""new normal"". We also went to buy from our favorite Filipino fastfood, Jollibee. Hope you enjoy the video!

One of the things I dearly missed in the Philippines is being able to easily buy Pinoy bread. Bakeries are scattered around the streets and anyone rarely runs into the conundrum of not knowing where to buy one. Thankfully, for us Filipinos who live here in the United States, and those who love Filipino bread regardless of one's ethnicity, I found just where (and from whom) to buy these local favorites when you're craving one.

In this video, I will be joined by my good friend, Dolly. Dolly is a fellow Filipino US immigrant and the owner of Dollycious Goodies. We will be talking about how she started her business as well as the types of bread available for sale. Deliveries are applicable to most states excluding Hawaii and Alaska.

For more information, including the pricelist and the complete list of delivery availability, you can visit their Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/Dollycious-Goodies-101344801729161

If you have anymore queries, don't hesitate to message them on Facebook.

Enjoy the video! (Please turn on the Closed Captions/Subtitles so you can follow through with the discussion in the video as the unwanted background noise may muddle with our voices)

A friend of mine brought this back from Philippines and shipped them to me in 2 boxes and paid around £16.20 for the food and £16.60 for the shipping. I think I got the numbers right. Shipping costs more which is unbelievable.

Love Your Adobo (My Filipino) [Lyrics]
I love

Handa na ako

I
Love your adobo
Gutom ako
Yah give me some more
Penge ako
Chicken adobo
Handa na ako
My Filipino

I

Seven people on the clock yah
Wanna grab the best meat on the farm ah
Who among them has the fluffy feathers
Make sure the grip is really hard
Yah they can't go

I am hungry now!
Wanna lick the soy sauce and
The stove is set to high
Remember to add
More vinegar and water
Cook it in whatever manner
That is perfect and desired

I can't wait for it tonight
You make sure it's thick enough
I'm ready to taste it, you
Can taste this adobo too

Yo ah me and seven of you
This chicken adobo, Good!
Must share our blessings too
Cause I…

Love your adobo
Gutom ako
Yah give me some more
Penge ako
Chicken adobo
Handa na ako
My Filipino

I
Love your adobo
Gutom ako
Yah give me some more
Penge ako
Chicken adobo
Handa na ako

Ingredients:
-1 Melona Bar, melted
-½ c. Sweet Rice Flour
-⅓ c. Sugar (I wish I didn't add this - try it and let me know how it turns out!) 
-Sweet Red Bean Paste
-Coconut Flakes

Directions:
1) I melted the ube melona, and added it to ½ cup sweet rice flour and ⅛ c. sugar.
2) Then I steamed it in a pot for 15 minutes, stirring halfway through.
3) Once that was done I used corn starch to powder the super soft dough and rolled it out to about an inch thick.
4) Then I cut out circles and filled them with a red bean paste.
5. Then I closed em up and topped with coconut flakes

This tomato-based Filipino stew marries hearty vegetables, peas, and olives with tender chicken thighs. To amplify the flavors and keep the chicken skin crispy, Melissa roasts the chicken separately from the veg, reuniting them just before plating.

INGREDIENTS
For the chicken:
1 carrot, finely chopped 
1 celery stalk, finely chopped 
½ large yellow onion, finely chopped 
1 red bell pepper, finely chopped 
5 garlic cloves, roughly chopped 
2 Tbsp. olive oil
4-6 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 lb.)
1 cup chicken stock 
1 14.5-oz. can diced tomatoes 
3  bay leaves 
1 Tbsp. soy sauce 
1 Tbsp. fish sauce 
Johnny’s seasoning salt

For the roasted vegetables:
4 small carrots, roll cut 
8 oz. heirloom potatoes, quartered
2 medium red bell pepper, seeded, cut into bite size pieces
½ cup olive oil
Johnny’s seasoning salt

To finish:
½ cup frozen green peas 
¼ cup Castelvetrano olives, pitted 
¼ cup Kalamata olives, pitted

Chicken + Sauce Prep 
- Preheat oven to 425. 
- Heat olive oil in a large deep sided skillet until hot. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper then brown the chicken skin side down for 5-7 minutes until golden. Turn the chicken around and brown on the other side for 2 minutes then remove and set aside on a plate. 
- Add the finely chopped carrot, celery, onion and red bell pepper and saute until soft but not browned around 5 minutes. 
- Once soft, add the garlic and bay and saute for another 2 minutes. 
- Add the tomatoes and stock, fish sauce and soy sauce and stir everything together. Taste to see if you need to add more salt and pepper. Finally, add the chicken back to the skillet and place in the oven. Bake for 45 min. 
- Take out and add olives and green peas and roasted veggies. If you want to reduce the sauce, take out chicken and put back on the stove. 
- Skin should be crispy and delicious. 
Roasting Veggies 
- Place your potatoes and carrots in a large bowl and toss with vegetable and salt and pepper and place on a baking sheet tray and place in the oven to roast. (20 min) - Toss your red bell pepper in vegetable oil and place on another baking sheet try and place in oven to roast (10 min)

▶️ Please Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/@RobbieTravels 

There are many different kinds of food in the Philippines. Sometimes  It's sour from the coconut vinegar that ages in barrels in the backyard, and it's sweet from the sugar cane that grows tall in the fields of Negros Occidental. But it's not spicy unless you go to Bicol.

Since I am staying in Legazpi, I decided to try their world-famous spicy Filipino food. So, I went to 1st Colonial Grill at Pacific Mall in Legazpi to try it out. This restaurant is known for its unique dishes, like Sili Ice Cream and Bicol Express.

First, I gave their Bicol Express a try. This food is made with chili peppers, shrimp paste, coconut milk, and pork. It's definitely spicy, but it's also very flavorful.

Then, I ordered their Sili ice cream. This ice cream is made with real chili peppers and comes in four levels of heat: Level 1 is not very spicy, Level 2 is a little spicy, Level 3 is very spicy, and Level 4 is Volcano Level.

So I decided to challenge myself and try the Volcano Level. This is the hottest level, and it's not for people who can't handle the heat.

The heat was unbearable, but the flavor was well worth it. The chili peppers give the ice cream a taste I've never had before.

I can't believe I tried it, but it was an exciting experience. If you're looking for a challenge, try the Volcano Level Sili Ice Cream at 1st Colonial Grill.

Then I headed to the Legazpi City Public Market. This market is great for fresh fruits and vegetables, seafood, and souvenirs.

Lastly, I ended my day at Ayala Malls Legazpi. This mall has a lot of shops and places to eat, and it's a great place to relax and do some shopping.

That's all for today's video. Thanks for watching and let me know which food do you want to try?

Today, we're thrilled to take you on a delightful culinary adventure to the vibrant Sugbo Mercado in Cebu. Join us, Mads and I, as we embark on a quest to discover the tantalizing flavors of Lechon, Balut, Sisig, and much more! 

▶️Please Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/@RobbieTravels

Nestled amidst the bustling city of Cebu, Sugbo Mercado stands as a culinary haven, a weekend market brimming with the essence of local flavors and culture. 

Every Saturday and Sunday, from 4 pm to 12 midnight, this vibrant marketplace transforms into a symphony of aromas, sights, and sounds, enticing visitors to immerse themselves in Cebu's rich culinary heritage.

As we ventured into Sugbo Mercado, our senses were immediately captivated by the tantalizing aroma of grilled meats and the lively chatter of vendors and patrons. Our first culinary stop was at a stall specializing in Lechon, the iconic roasted pig dish that has become a symbol of Filipino cuisine. The glistening skin, the succulent meat, and the explosion of flavors were an absolute delight to our taste buds.

Next, we dared to try Balut, a fertilized duck egg that is considered a delicacy in the Philippines. While the initial apprehension was palpable, we took a deep breath and braced ourselves for the unique culinary experience. The combination of the soft, flavorful egg and the slightly developed duckling was a testament to the adventurous spirit of Filipino cuisine.

Our culinary journey continued with Sisig, a sizzling dish made from chopped pork ears, cheeks, and liver, seasoned with onions, chili peppers, and calamansi. The contrast of textures, from the crispy pork ears to the soft liver, and the symphony of flavors were an explosion in our mouths.

Beyond the tantalizing flavors, Sugbo Mercado also offered a glimpse into the rich tapestry of Cebu's culture. We wandered through stalls brimming with handcrafted souvenirs, each piece a testament to the artistry and creativity of the local artisans. The vibrant colors, intricate designs, and unique materials spoke volumes about the cultural heritage that has been passed down through generations.

Our hearts were filled with gratitude for the unforgettable gastronomic experiences and the cultural immersion we had just experienced. 

Sugbo Mercado stands as a testament to the vibrant spirit of Cebu, a place where food and culture intertwine to create an unforgettable experience for every visitor.

This time I'm oomphing it up with some coconut milk and caramelized pineapple. I'm using pork belly for this which I think is the perfect fatty tender cut to pair with tart juicy pineapple. I got the idea from you guys! On my original Chicken Adobo video, many of you left comments about your favourite adobo variation, and some people said pineapple, others said coconut milk. I thought it would be fantastic to put BOTH these things in the dish and my gosh is it GOOD! 

If you've tried my first adobo, try this one, because it is BETTER!

By tradition, the souring ingredient of this dish comes from a tamarind fruit. Through time, this souring ingredient diversed and instead of using tamarind, guava, calamansi, bilimbi (kamias), unripe green mango, or santol can also be used. Today, a popular powdered sour-soup based ingredient called the ""Sinigang Mix"" is commonly used.

jB3WygJ47A0,2020-03-13T03:10:47Z,UCp1KrVaZDZ7BOI_QBuTWWmg,Award-winning chef and TV host highlights Seattle's Filipino food scene - KING 5 Evening,"On the PBS show, No Passport Required, award-winning chef and Restaurateur Marcus Samuelsson explores the diversity of immigrant traditions that are now part of American culture.  Samuelsson says, ""food to me has always told a deeper more personal story."" And he found plenty of examples of that when taking a deep dive into Seattle's Filipino food scene. 

Filipino Food is influenced by Spanish, Chinese and Malaysian traditions. But it has a flavor all its own. 

During his visit to the Northwest, Samuelsson visited iconic spots like The Oriental Mart at Pike Place Market, which just won a prestigious James Beard award. It was named a ""2020 American Classic."" 

But he also discovered some emerging spots for Filipino food, like Hood Famous now in the Chinatown International District and Archipelago in South Seattle.  

Washington is home to the fifth-largest Filipino population in the United States.

And just last year, state lawmakers voted to make October Filipino American History Month. Samuelsson says this episode celebrating the Filipino food scene reinforces something he keeps learning with each show.

""I've learned we all come from somewhere and we have a sense of pride. But then we want to explore [...] People are passionate about the United States and also about their roots."" 

To see the full episode filmed in Seattle, visit PBS' website.

Evening on KING 5 celebrates the Northwest. Watch it LIVE weekdays at 7:30 on KING 5 or streaming on https://www.king5.com/. Find more stories like this on our website: https://www.king5.com/evening

8UQB5t_euOI,2020-02-07T22:00:17Z,UCgMWh4K-8a8QajV9rtZHZ9A,FILIPINO DAD COOKS PORK ADOBO,"Philippine Adobo (from Spanish adobar: “marinade,” “sauce” or “seasoning”) is a popular Filipino dish and cooking process in Filipino cuisine that involves meat, seafood, or vegetables marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and black peppercorns, which is browned in oil, and simmered in the marinade. It has occasionally been considered as the unofficial national dish in the Philippines. The cooking method for the Philippine adobo is indigenous to the Philippines. Pre-colonial Filipinos often cooked or prepared their food with vinegar and salt to keep them fresh longer in the tropical climate of the Philippines. Vinegar, in particular, is one of the most important ingredients in Filipino cuisine, with four main traditional types: coconut vinegar, cane vinegar, nipa palm vinegar and kaong palm vinegar, all of which are linked to traditional alcohol fermentation.
 
While the adobo dish and cooking process in Filipino cuisine and the general description of adobo in Spanish cuisine share similar characteristics, they refer to different things with different cultural roots. Unlike the Spanish and Latin American adobo, the main ingredients of Philippine adobo are ingredients native to Southeast Asia, namely soy sauce (originally salt), black peppercorns, and bay leaves. It does not traditionally use chilis, paprika, oregano, or tomatoes. Its only similarity to Spanish and Latin American adobo is the primary use of vinegar and garlic. Philippine adobo has a characteristically salty and sour (and often sweet) taste, in contrast to Spanish and Mexican adobos which are spicier or infused with oregano. 

A rarer version without soy sauce is known as adobong puti (""white adobo"" or ""blond adobo""), which uses salt instead, to contrast it with adobong itim (""black adobo""), the more prevalent versions with soy sauce. Adobong puti is often regarded as the closest to the original version of the Pre-Hispanic adobo. It is similar to another dish known as pinatisan, where patis (fish sauce) is used instead of vinegar.

Ingredients:
3 lbs – Pork Belly (big cubes)
1 whole head – Garlic (chopped)
3 ea – Bay Leaves
1 tbsp – Whole Peppercorns
½ cup – Vinegar
½ cup – Soy Sauce
2 cups – Water 

Recommended Brand of Soy Sauce & Vinegar: 
Silver Swan Soy Sauce – What I always use 
Marca Pina Soy Sauce – My 2nd choice 
Datu Puti (Cane Vinegar) – What I always use 
Tropics Brand – My 2nd choice
